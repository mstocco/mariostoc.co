# üèÜ FIRST PLACE MALE 50-59

---

A local Sprint Distance Triathlon that I entered on a whim, 
30 minutes before registration closed.

I seeded myself at the front of the group and when the starter 
said _"Go!"_, I hit the water with intension.  A bit of an odd 
side-stitch during the swim, otherwise felt good.

<!---->
On the bike, I was passed by _Niki S._ on _Oldfield Road_. 
She was quick heading to the top of _Old West Saanich Road_ but
I returned the favour before getting down to the bottom of 
the hill.

From that point on, I became her _"rabbit"_ that she'd 
chase on the bike course.

My heart-rate was on average 145&#8239;BPM, uphills into the 
150's.  Fun, but way higher than I typically ride at.

Once into my running shoes, I settled into a comfortable 
_5:10/km_ pace on the trail.  Early into the run, _Niki_ would
pass me for good. I was passed by a two more men but 
that's it.

After the turnaround, I watched who in the outbound crowd 
could make ground and catch me.  The answer today was none; 
I was solo through to a solid finish.

Fun race.  It was fun play near the front of the pack but I 
make no illusions from the result.  It is not like that 
_Whitfield_ guy showed up.

Weather: ‚òÄÔ∏è 25¬∞C and zero wind.
