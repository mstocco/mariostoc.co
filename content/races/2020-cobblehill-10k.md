# 2020 Cobble Hill 10K
Sunday, January 26th, 2020

The weather forecast was wrong and the +600 participants of 
this year's Cobble Hill 10K were the better for it.  Today was 
one of those Cowichan Valley winter days the local residents 
enjoy; tee-shirt and shorts type of weather while the rest of 
Canada is bundled up and dealing with below freezing temperatures.

Starting at George Bonner School, the course is scenic, following 
the country roads around Cobble Hill. It traditionaly produced some 
fast times for many runners. This annual race is hosted by the 
_CEEVACS Road Runners_, and has course records of 30:46 (Geoff Martinson)
and 34:44 (Cheryl Murphy).

I was at the event with my friend Jonas Jorgensen; it was his first
organized 10k race.  Shoes laced and bib numbers secured, we headed out an
jogged the first kilometre or so for a warmup.

The race started and Jonas and I set off with the crowd along Cobble Hill
Road.

The course featured a short out and back along Wilkinson Road; at pace,
the out and back looked and felt less hilly than what we jogged on the warmup.

An optically challenging false flat lead to the turnaround at Hutchinson Road.
The road back, was just the opposite; the very gradual climb of Cobble Hill 
Road is now a very gradual descent.  We kept a steady effort enjoyed the uptick
in pace that the grade provided.  

The course left Cobble Hill Road for a rolling section through kilometres 8 and 9. 
Jonas looked at me as if he wanted permission to crank it up for the finish.  I 
said, "Yes, go for it!" and I watched him lengthen his stride on the way to the finish.
I started my push too but there wasn't much pop left in my legs.  As Jonas disappeared 
up the road, I resigned to pushing as hard as I could and maintaining form.

Strides on Friday's workout? You'd better believe I was feeling them on the final few
hundred metres.

I hit the line with a **New PB: 47:14**!

A new Personal Best! **47 minutes, 14 seconds**.
