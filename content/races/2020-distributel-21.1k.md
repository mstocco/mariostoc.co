# Distributel 21.1KM Challenge
Saturday, June 26, 2020

The morning started well.  I woke rested and started my day the 
same way, at the same time as any other summer day.  Coffee, 
two bagels, a shower and I was out the door.

The route I picked for the challenge was an out an back along 
the flattest terrain local to the Greater Victoria area.  After 
a short 15 minute drive, I parked my vehicle at Lochside Park. 
There was a gusty wind blowing through the trees but at ground 
level, it wasn't bad.  With an overcast sky, this morning's 
weather seemed to be shaping up for an excellent day for a hard 
effort.

I had a warm up scheduled so I headed south along Lochside Trail. 
Nothing unexpected on the warm-up; I think we are all systems go.  

The trail north from Lochside Park is smooth, hard-<wbr />packed
gravel. I programmed my watch to beep at me at the first two 500m 
marks.  My first glance at the watch showed __5:03min/km__; at the 
1km mark it was reading __5:11min/km__.

I am comfortable and set for a really good day.

As Lochside Trail winds its way north, the trail leaves its 
forested section becoming tranquil farmland.  The surface 
varies from sections of paved asphalt, gravel and chip seal. 
Sometimes it is a flat country road, some parts are multi-use, 
cycling path. Seven and a half kilometres into the run, I am 
off the bike path and running along the shoulder of Lochside 
Drive.  The farmland has been replaced with a highway to my 
right and ocean-front homes to my left.  I am feeling good; 
really good and I think I am running the pace that I found at 
the 1km mark.  If I am not on pace, I am certainly on effort.

There is a long, straight section of Lochside Drive and at its 
end is Cy Hampson Park; the park is popular spot for dog owners 
to let their companions run.  Near the centre of the park, a 
convenient white line painted on the shoulder of the road; 
this is my turn around point.  Reaching that line has me at 
10.7km into the run and the emotional half-way point.

Turning around has me focused on the long white line that separates 
Lochside Drive's

<!---->southbound traffic from its shoulder.  I am on 
effort and still feeling really good.  Running that long white 
line is bringing me home.

15 kilometres and I am noticing that things are needing more 
focus.  I am about to leave the roadway and continue south on 
the bike path.  Generally I ask myself, what is my limiter?  
Is it my legs or is it my lungs?  Today it is my quads, glutes 
and hamstrings that are starting to have their conversation 
heard.  I am trying to block it out, sipping more energy drink 
and carrying on.  The area is opening back up into farmland 
again and the headwind is noticed; this is one more thing to 
try and block out.

There is a dull ache coming from my legs so I tell myself, 
_"these legs are just fine, this is just an interpretation
in my head."_ Do I believe that?  _"Yes"_.  Is this pace
becoming more difficult to hold?  _"Absolutely"_.

Just like I set my watch to beep a couple of times at the 
start of the run, I have it set to beep at 2km, 1km and 200m 
from the finish.  I think I am about a kilometre away from 
they next time my watch goes beep.  I look around, taking in 
the farmland that I am running past.

<!---->
I have slowed.  Not only am I feeling it in my legs, I can see 
how much slower I am moving down the road.  _"Pick it up!"_
3km is about 15 minutes according to the fuzzy math in my head. 
Surely I can concentrate on this task for 15 minutes.

Another beep from the watch, 1 kilometre through this forested 
road.  The trees on either side of me are in contrast to the 
wide-<wbr />open fields of just a minute ago.  The trees give 
me the illusion that I am running faster.  My legs and now my 
lungs tell a more truthful story.  I pick a spot as far up the 
trail as I can and focus on getting to that spot.  It hurts. 
Form, cadence, rhythm; those things are long gone.  Just get 
to that spot.

One last beep from the watch; 200 meters to go.  I can see my 
vehicle in the parking lot ahead.  It looks like it is just 
100 metres away and I wonder how much further past it I will 
have to run to measure out the full 21.1 km.  Keep digging!

Beep, beep, beep!  Looking at my watch to see "Workout complete". 
I find the stop button and press it as quick as I can.  No sense 
recording more time that I need to.  Now the unforgiving clock 
appears on the watch.  __1:55:04__.  

<!---->
The happiness of finishing a virtual half marathon disappears at 
that press of a button.  Hrmmm...  I feel quite disappointed with 
the truth in front of me.  I run back through my head, where did
that time go?  I can't find fault with pacing.  If I started this 
run faster, I likely would have faded quicker too.  

This was the best I could express today.  It is nowhere near my 
best from previous tests from just this past January (10K PR) 
and October (42.2K PR).  

My goal to become a better runner is not done.
