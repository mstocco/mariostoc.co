# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, May 21, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**5** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Marry my sweetheart then prep for a 70.3

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **7&#8239;Hours**

I feel like I was **PEAKING**

This week I married Carina at an intimate ceremony in front of close friends and family and live streamed to other loved ones across the world.  Pretty awesome feeling for the two of us.

This made for a natural dip in the training schedule and I feel like I am the better for it.  The lighter load going into this year's [Victoria 70.3](/racereports/2023-ironman-70.3-victoria) certainly will help.

I felt fresh on a bike ride up to Langford and go into a lake for the first time this spring/summer.  Things are pretty awesome.

25m lane.

Pretty descent tailwind pushed me up the hill into _Langford_. 
The route included _Humpback Road_ and a trip on over the 
_West Shore Parkway_. Effort was as written (easy) and I would 
say this was a nice ride in the sunshine and with a bit of 
practice with the wind.

I hosted my cousin for dinner and did not walk an intentional 
30 minutes.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Time: **120&#8239;Mins** &nbsp; OWS: **~2.4&#8239;km** &nbsp; Walk/Jog: **7&#8239;km**

The first open water swim of the season and it could not have 
gone any better. My brain picked up on the change in position 
that the wetsuit affords me (floating my legs higher).
<!----->
I really felt that the weeds below me went past noticeably 
faster than the tiles on the bottom of the pool.  Everything 
worked. I forgot Vaseline, didn't matter as there was no 
chaffing.

Water temperature was good; the algae in Elk Lake is present 
though not as bad as last year.  I accidentally chose _"Run"_ 
to record the activity on my watch and the GPS smoothing 
algorithm recorded the track way longer and jagged than what 
was actual.

---

Straight out of the water, I did the walk/run in my Adidas 
shoes on the north end of the _Elk Lake Trail_.  If this 
afternoon is any indication, it is going to be incredibly 
frustrating having to walk on [Sunday](/racereports/2023-ironman-70.3-victoria). 

Jogging felt really comfortable.

Seeing some out of town athletes and the build out of the 
IRONMAN event at _Hamsterly Beach_ fired me up.

## FRIDAY MAY 26 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Ride: Dead bugs, breathing, Glute Bridges...:20-:30 second side planks, :30 front planks.

Ride 60 minutes EASY. Flatter route. On the TT bike. 

Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **42&#8239;Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **17&#8239;km**

Ran a bit short on time as I was playing bike mechanic.  Rear carrier now has a CO<sub>2</sub> and tire lever set bolted on.  A spare tube with a long enough extension to work on the back wheel is secured back there too.

New latex tubes installed and the chain cleaned and oiled.  I also replaced the uncut aero-bars with the pair from my old bike; they fit the position I've been playing with on the new bike.  The TT Bike looks ready to race now.

The ride was a loop of the _Goose/E&N bike paths_ to confirm everything works.  I did pick up a shard of glass, heard it then stopped to pick it out of the tire casing before it pierced the brand new tube.  Luck is on my side this week.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Walk ~ 60 minutes. 

Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **35&#8239;Minutes** &nbsp; Walk: **3.5&#8239;km**

I rode from _Beaver Lake_ to the bike check-in at _Hamsterly Beach_.  I honestly would have loved to go for a longer ride today; save it for [tomorrow](/racereports/2023-ironman-70.3-victoria).

After mulling about the _"Village"_, I decided skip the bus ride back to the parking lot and to make today's walk a trek on the running path instead.  Took me a less time than I thought but it was during the heat of the day and my shoulders were starting to burn.  

I napped, maybe an hour, before dinner.
