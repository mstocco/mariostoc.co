# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, May 23, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**18 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Keep on working.  With each week ticking away and the anticipation and anxiousness grows.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **IN A NICE GROOVE**

Maybe it was the day off on [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');), but this week was what it should all be about.  Runs felt good, time on the bike felt good and the swim on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) was really good too.

**11 hours 45 minutes** with the day off training; that was only 50 minutes shy of [last week](ironman2021-15weeksout).

## SUNDAY MAY 23 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 90 minutes. Flat/rolling route. EASY effort. Elk Lake/Goose/Lochside/Waterfront/Panama Flats kind of terrain. 
Stay well fueled. 
2nd: Can be directly after the ride but later in the day will probably be more fun!
Mountain bike 75 minutes. Get outside. Spin the legs a bit. Hit a few trails. Have fun. Main goal is to be on a bike and move the legs. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **135 mins** &nbsp; Run: **16km** &nbsp; Ride: **23km**

Carina dropped me off at Michells Farm and I jogged home from there.  Decent headwind and in sections sheltered from the wind but not the sun, it was quite warm.  I **felt good** but not as fresh as when I did this route back in [January](ironman2021-32weeksout?sun).

With an easier, +3 hour ride [yesterday](ironman2021-15weeksout?sat), I felt less fatigue in my legs compared to a week ago.

#### RUN: Michell Farm to Tillicum 
![Run Map](/assets/jpg/run-20210523.jpeg)

I was invited for dinner with my in-laws so I jumped on the TT bike for a run up to _Sidney_.  The mountain bike is fun but the TT bike can be fun too.  It is rare for me to ride mostly uninterrupted for just ~20km on the road so I took this as a chance to learn and make mental notes of the effort and distance.

Given the headwind experienced on the run a couple hours earlier, I expected to get a push for the ride in the opposite direction.  A decent tailwind through to _Elk Lake_ died off near the intersection of _Island View Road_.  Then it was a slight headwind for the remainder of the ride.

#### RIDE: Uptown to Sidney

Off Training.

Good thing too.  The weather forecast calls for rain all day and I woke with another headache.  My mistake; I don't think I had enough for dinner last night.

## TUESDAY MAY 25 üå¶
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Option 1: am: Run, Pm: Ride.   
Option 2: Pm: ride w/ run off.   
Ride 80 minutes. Spin 25-30 minutes easy (Maybe a bit extra on the way out vs back home). (Towards Mill hill) 5x 3:00 #1: Steady climbing to warm up. #2-5 @ a touch easier than 20k effort, 2-3 minutes easy after each. 20-25 minutes easy riding to cool down.  
Run 30 minutes easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 minutes**

Rain in the morning meant "Option 2".

It was a long day on the keyboard and I really did not feel like going for a bike ride.  I would have been ok if there was just a 30 minute run scheduled.  Regardless of how I felt, I pulled the road bide off the wall, lubed the chain and pumped up the tires.
<!---->
Not long after I set off for the _Crystal View_ subdivision (_Mill Hill_), I noticed an odd, random click coming from the drive train.  I spun around for home and put the bike on my work stand.  My guess is there is a bit of play in the bottom bracket bearings and I can't add anymore preload to adjust it.  This was my winter bike and hasn't seen a real mechanic in a year.

Satisfied that I did my best to solve the noise, I headed back out to get my workout done.

Every rep tonight went to the very top of the hill (_Goldstone Heights_).   Maybe it was yesterday's day off training but climbing this evening felt easier compared to the last time I did a reps in this subdivision.

#### Elevation Profile for the Ride
![Elevation Profile](/assets/jpg/elevation-20210525.jpeg)

I felt **strong on the bike** this evening.  I stayed out of the 30 tooth cog for the fifth trip up and did an extra hard standing effort to the elementary school for good measure.

<!---->
I felt **really strong** on the run tonight too.

The awkward "jelly legs" did not last but a couple of minutes and I clocked almost 32 minutes at my marathon pace with an average heart-rate of just 126 BPM.  

#### Small Changes to the 30 minute route 
![Run Map](/assets/jpg/runmap-20210525.jpeg)
I didn't just run the flat bike path either; I ran along _Douglas_ and _Finlayson_ to give this run a rolling profile.

Time for a shower and dinner; it's burritos tonight!

## WEDNESDAY MAY 26 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 75 minutes. Flat route. 15 minutes easy running to warm up. 12x :20 strides, 1:10 easy jogging after each. Breathing should be full returned to normal after each rep. Easy running for the remainder of the run. 
Bring a gel/calorie source. 100 calories should be plenty.

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12.5 km**

Run felt good, strides felt good; my right ankle was a bit tight through the first 30 minutes but good to go after that.  Basically some easy mileage before a late pasta dinner.

Unsettled weather and a desire not to ride in the wet meant I drove to the pool this morning.

![Swim Chart](/assets/jpg/swim-20210527.jpeg)
<!---->
Two things I noticed in the water this morning.  First, I noticed that swim frequency (or lack of) is a thing; not being in the water for a week made at least the first lengths as much of a "feel out process" as it was a warm-up.  Second, my non-dominant arm (left) could use some work.

Some minor lane congestion in the pool this morning but it has been worse.

---

Even though the morning rain gave way to sunshine, I didn't get the ride done in the morning.

Instead, after a long work day, I finally got on the TT bike at 2100 for a very light, pre-bedtime spin.  I pedalled for 50 minutes (51 total activity time) on the rollers and watched a portion of the IM Tulsa race.  At one point, the camera was on Andy Costas as he attempted to navigate a wet corner; he went down and my first reaction was to sit up.

### NOTES

Easy jog on the bike path to _Quadra Street_ to finish up the evening.  I had butter chicken for dinner and that may not have been the best meal before a jog.  No aches or pains.

### NOTES

Biked to and from the _Esquimalt Rec Centre_ this sunny morning (road bike).
<!---->
I booked the _"Fast Lane"_ today and I was surprised to find that it was configured as a single lane this morning.  Luckily for me, I was the only one to show up and I had the lane all to myself.  The first of the 25m Strong lengths came in at 20 seconds.  I was a bit disappointed in that.  Every 25m Strong length was faster and done on average in 18.7 seconds.  I did the first 300m in 5:48 (1:56/100m) and the second a bit slower in 5:53 (1:58/100m).  I swam the final 150m at 1:44/100m pace.

#### 25m Strides (but in the pool)
![Swim Pace Chart](/assets/jpg/swim-20210529.jpeg)

On the ride home, I met up with a guy named Ryan.  He was about my age and just getting back from his 100km ride.  He is signed up for _Penticton_ too.  I hope to see him there.
<!---->
At 1615 in the afternoon, I jumped on the TT bike, I made my way via _Interurban_, out to _Willis Point Road_ for some hill work.

I seem to have deleted the lap screen on my bike computer so I did the efforts on memory; meaning I seem to recall that from the bottom of the hill to _Durrance Lake_ would be pretty close to 10 minutes per effort.  This turned out to be a good guess.  The third time up I started to feel the work in my quads; regardless, I pushed through and finished that last trip to the lake strong.

I had my nephew's birthday party to get to in Sidney, so once back down on _Wallace Drive_, I turned north and put my head down for a steady push up the peninsula.  I started to find a comfortably hard rhythm and went with it up the _Pat Bay Highway_ to _Resthaven Drive_.

Looking back, my thoughts were on the 3x10 minutes and I didn't remember the cadence work.  üò°
