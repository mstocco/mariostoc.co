# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, September 20, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(3);)

**53 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Some more riding, some more running and more mobility.
[Last week](ironman2021-50weeksout), I missed scheduled 
training on two days; my goal this week is get all of the 
activities in. 

## SUMMARY
I feel like I **STARTED A GOOD STREAK**

My goal this week was to get every scheduled workout completed; 
_weekly goal accomplished!_. [Monday](javascript:flkty.select(5);)
was the hardest day for motivation but getting out on the TT 
Bike on [Tuesday](javascript:flkty.select(6);) under sunny 
skies set the tone for the remainder of the week.

This was a **nine hour** week and a nice bump from the 
previous 3 weeks.  I am feeling good about the effort too.

This was the first week of Autumn and [mid-week](javascript:flkty.select(7);) 
the weather has changed accordingly.

## SUNDAY SEP 20 ☀
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes  
Ride 1:30-1:45. Flatter ride on the road bike. 
If your MTB is up and rolling, I'm very much ok with this 
being an 80-90 minute fun MTB ride on some dirt roads/trails.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 minutes**

There was an option for a MTB ride an I took it after an 
inspection of the front wheel on the road bike.  Before I 
headed out, I had a flat to repair; that caused a nasty gash 
across 2 fingers.  Grrrr...

I headed out toward Thetis without much of a plan except to be 
out for 90 minutes.  The park was busy with people.  I skipped 
my favourite single track and took the fire road to the base 
of Mount Stewart.  By that point, I had been pedalling for 40 
minutes.

<!---->
From the base, I walked my bike up the steep sections until I 
got to the summit. After a bit of time soaking in the sunshine, 
I headed back down to Scafe Hill, then to Bellamy and the 
fireroad route out of Thetis Lake Park.

I took it easy as I am naturally fatigued from yesterday’s 
effort.  This was **a really fun ride** and as the trails are 
dry (for now)

## MONDAY SEP 21 &#127780;
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 20 minutes  
Run 30 minutes. Flat and easy 

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

I had a so-so sleep last night even though the Seahawks beat 
the Patriots with a defensive stand on the last play.  I am 
particularly tight in my left hip and need time with the 
lacrosse ball to get the tissue to calm down.

I did a lap of Swan Lake.  I walked for 5 minutes before 
hitting start on the watch, jogged for 31 minutes and walked 
for five minutes after.  I picked the trail over the road 
because I am more **sore today** than I was yesterday.  My 
motivation wasn't all that high but I remembered my goal of 
getting all the workouts in this week and out the door I went.
I am glad I did too because the rain is coming, likely tomorrow.

## TUESDAY SEP 22 &#127780;
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 45 minutes. Easy spinning. Nothing too hard.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes**

I slept well last night and woke up feeling rested though I 
do have some lingering soreness from last weekend.

The workout today called for rollers but I was done work early 
and the weather was nice so I prepped the TT Bike and went for 
a spin.  I figured if I was scheduled for 45 minutes on the 
rollers, I should be looking at a little longer than an hour 
outside and not on an overly hilly route.  I headed out to 
Langford before looping back through Esquimalt.

This was the first ride on the TT bike since Elk Lake in 
August and it **felt really good**.

## WEDNESDAY &mdash MY 49TH BIRTHDAY! &#127783;
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**   
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 15 minutes  
Run 30 minutes flat and easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

Another night with a restful sleep.  I am still a bit tight 
through the hips and piriformis.  I'll roll out well before 
heading out on my jog.

So the **rain** is here.  I headed out for a 30 minute jog to 
the center of the trestle and back.  The effort was scheduled 
as easy and for the most part, it was; my breathing was easy 
and my focus was on running comfortably.  I ended with 30 
minutes at **5:35/km** which seems like a touch fast (or the 
new normal).  If anything was complaining, it is the usual 
suspects of soleus and ankles but overall, this **felt better** 
than Monday's run.

## THURSDAY SEP 24 &#127783;
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**   
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Hilly road ride or Fun MTB ~ 75-90 minutes. Easy effort on the 
flats/downhills, more of a moderate effort on the uphills.

<p><span class="agencyvc">UPDATE:</span> I got the ok to ride the rollers tonight.</p>

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

A little _"vino rosso"_ at last night's birthday dinner may 
have made my sleep feel a bit off.  It is a rain day and I 
will need to play bike mechanic before heading out after work.

60 Minutes steady state on the rollers with an average RPM of 
88 and tire pressure of 70 psi.  This was an **easy effort** 
for the lungs and legs but my sit bones (and region) was sore 
after this indoor spin.

## FRIDAY SEP 25 &#127782;
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**   
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 15 minutes  
Run 50 minutes: 30 minutes easy running to warm up. 8x :30 
uphill strides a touch stronger than 5k effort, 1:00 easy 
downhill jog after each. 8 minutes easy running to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **85 minutes**

I think I slept well last night as I went to bed an hour 
earlier.

I had a work lunch that had me commute to Broadmead for 
&plusmn;30 minutes on the bike.

It seems like forever since my coach has put a structured run 
like this into my inbox; today was my lucky day.  I ran the 
strides up Inlet Avenue which worked out perfectly for the 30 
second efforts.  The warmup was a bit shorter and the cool 
down a bit longer; this run **felt good**.

## SATURDAY SEP 26 &#127783;
Sleep **1** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:00. Flatter roads. Road or TT bike. Whatever sounds more fun.

### NOTES
Total Time: **105 minutes**

I had a good sleep last night and it is house chores until the 
rain stops...

And after giving up on an hourly weather forcast that was wrong 
_all day_, I headed out to the garage, put on the NFL Network 
on the TV and pedalled the TT bike on the rollers until the 
odometer read _"40 km"_.  I mixed a strong solution of Gatorade 
that I sipped over the course of the 1:46 minutes and took the 
odd, short break to make sure my undercarriage didn't get too 
uncomfortable.  I spend the majority of the time balancing in 
the aerobars.

Effort was **easy spinning** and time seemed to go by quickly.
