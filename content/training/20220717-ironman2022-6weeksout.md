# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, July 17, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**6** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Recover from the race on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) 
before the hopefully a really big 4 weeks.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **14 Hours**

I feel like I was **READY FOR WHAT'S NEXT**

I think this was an pretty good week considering I how I 
absorbed the effort from the [race](racereports/2022-victoria-half) 
on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');).

Later in the week, I missed a run on [Thursday](javascript:flick('thu');) 
as my toe still needed more rest.  That rest led to my most 
comfortable run since its injury on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');).

I did have a bit of a motivational struggle getting out the 
door on [Friday](javascript:flick('fri');) but finished the 
ride on a high.

## MONDAY JUL 18 ☀️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **6** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Walk ~ 30 minutes. Nice easy stroll.

Mobility 33 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 Minutes**

My little toe feels **surprisingly good** today; I cannot explain it.  I am pretty stiff otherwise with the big offenders being glutes, quads and my right hamstring.

In lieu of the walk, I got some yard work done (~an hour on my feet).  Mobility work was completed too.

## TUESDAY JUL 19 ☀️
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Spin 45 minutes EASY. Any bike. Inside or outside.   
Mobility 19 minutes  

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **Rollers**

Another good sleep last night though I am still a bit stiff from [the race](/racereports/2022-victoria-half)

Given the bike option, why not both?  I rode my TT Bike on the rollers, but outside in the sunshine with no fan.  This was a hot sweaty 45 minutes at easy effort.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes on TT bike. Easy effort.   
Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 Minutes** &nbsp;Ride: **27 km**

I did not have the opportunity to glue a new tubular on the front wheel so my next best (only) option was my XC Bike.  I kept things easy, and headed out on the _Galloping Goose_, staying on the asphalt to the north end of _Thetis Lake Park_.  I did one run of single track on _Comfy Wooden Chair_ taking another **17 seconds off** my PR for that trail (now at 2:25).  The rest of the ride was fire road to _Langford_, and the _Goose_ home from the RCMP station.

I stopped ~200m from home to chat with my neighbour (~10 mins).  Pedalling that last bit home, I could feel fatigue in my legs that was mostly unnoticed during the ride.

## THURSDAY JUL 21 ☀️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Open Water swim: 
3x 3 minutes easy swimming to warm up. R ~ 1:00 after each. 
When ready....
3x 10 minutes steady and continuous. As usual, practicing swimming straight and finding a sustainable rhythm. R 1:30 after each.

2nd: Run 40 minutes. Easy effort. VERY EASY!

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 Minutes** &nbsp; OWS: **2.1 km**

I skipped the run but did commute to and from _Thetis Lake_ for roughly 40 minutes of cardio.  My toe was feeling on the sore side.

The swim was pretty straight forward too as it was roughly 10 minutes in a straight line from the main beach directly toward a rock on the far shore; no need to loop the islands.

## FRIDAY JUL 22 ☀️
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 3:00 on the TT bike. Include two trips up observatory and two trips up Willis. 
Effort should be as easy as you can climb the climbs. And just cruising around for the three hours. 
Standard fueling, standard hydration.

Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **181 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **71 km**

I rode this as it was written but it wasn't easy to get out the door.  I wanted to figure out a way to get the 11x30 cassette on the TT Bike but instead, kept the DeCadence wheels (11x25 on the rear) and put on a new Continental tubular on the front (original Pirelli was separating between the tread and the casing).

Stayed out for the full 3 hours and was really happy that I did.  QL/Back did okay too.

## SATURDAY JUL 23 ☀️
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 40 minutes EASY.  
Mobility 12 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **41 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **6.7 km**

In between birthday celebrations (and too much food), I set out for a run at the warmest part of the day.  My little toe felt the best its been since breaking it; no soreness during and no tingly nerve sensation either.  Carina rode her bike beside me and it was really nice to have her company.
