**37** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
&mdash;

## SUMMARY
<mark> Total Time: **0 Hours** </mark>

This was a period that I was dealing with meeting a critical 
timeline for a project at work and healing from a crash on my 
mountain bike.

Although I have been getting the odd workout in, meaningful 
consistent training (and writing things down) continues on 
[Boxing Day](ironman2022-35weeksout).
