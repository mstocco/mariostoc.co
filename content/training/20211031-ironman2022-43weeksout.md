<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride.....Great day for the MTB or road bike. Your choice. A few hills would be ideal, but nothing too serious. Don't go searching for every single hill you can find. üôÇ 
Ride 1:30-1:45. Get out in the sunshine!

Run 40 minutes. Easy effort. Rolling terrain is appropriate. 
Order is up to you

### NOTES
Total Time: **93 Minutes**

Waterfront (clockwise) but instead of riding down _Sinclair_, I rode up the north (easy) side of _Mount Tolmie_ before heading toward _The Uplands_.  Near the _Oak Bay Marina_, I was passed by a young woman decked out in sponsored kit; she was on a pretty nice (new) Factor road bike too.  I passed her back before the golf course and held pace through to _Fisherman's Wharf_.

A couple more lead exchanges with her and I was at home quicker than I was expecting.

Too stiff from the hike [yesterday](ironman2022-44weeksout?sat), I did a mobility routine, carved a pumpkin and called it a day.

Clear and cold in the morning so I rode to and from the pool.   

I had an OK workout and did the _"shark-fin"_ set for the first time; it was odd at first and took some adductor effort to hold on to the board.  Typical Monday in that it was busy as the swim club filtered in around 0610.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
am: Very easy 30 minute spin on the rollers.

Pm: Very similar to last week.....
Run w/ your buddies. Keep the effort as easy as you can. 
Around 8k in total.

### NOTES
Total Time: **55 Minutes** &nbsp; Avg Pace: **5:33/km**
Whiffed on the pre-work day session on the rollers.

Vincent ran with Yauki and me this afternoon and just like a couple weeks ago, the pace started easy and built over the course of the run.  The intention was for an 8 km run but at 7.5, the Yauki asked if we could slow the pace and stretch it out to 10.  The 3 of us ran 10km but the pace/effort remained far greater than _"easy"_.

I am calling this a **tempo run** and looking for to seeing how I recover over the next few days.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
am: Walk 30 minutes to start the day. Just a walk. 
Pm: Ride 60 minutes. Inside or outside. Any bike you like. 
20 minutes easy to start: 10x :30 high cadence, 1:30 easy spinning after each. 20 minutes easy/steady riding to finish up.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **rollers/road bike**

Got in a ~40 minute nap at the end of the work day!  I don't know exactly when I fell asleep but Alex Dowsett was ~25 minutes into his hour record attempt and when I woke, it was over.

I put on a podcast for audio and the Jay Hiebs 60' (condensed) video of the entire IRONMAN Canada bike course.  Nothing extraordinary to say about the ride.  I am feeling stiff from the run [yesterday](javascript:flick('tue');).  

No walk in the morning.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2100:  4 rounds (50 easy free, 50 as 25 backstroke/25 free (Just do what you can), 50 as 25 Front scull while kicking, 25 swim r :20 after each) 4x 50 as 25 high turnover/stronger effort/25 relaxed/longer stroke r :30.  6 rounds (50 Fist drill w/ buoy and really focusing on a solid catch r :30, 150 aerobic/steady w/ focus on catch r :40) 
100 easy to cool down.

Optional: Easy spin to/from the pool.

### NOTES
Total Time: **55 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2100m**

I had a hard(er) time getting out of bed this morning.

The forecast was for rain but I had some luck and was dry on the ride to and from the pool.  I took the MTB because it at least has mud guards and it rolls over the decomposing leaf litter more confidently.

The swim was different with the new (to me) sculling drill; it was easier than I was expecting it to be.  The pull buoy needing to be juggled on the main set.
