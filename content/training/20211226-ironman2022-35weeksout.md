# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, December 26, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**35** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Snow on the ground and temperatures below zero.  The goal is to take advantage of the time off work and stay active.

## SUMMARY
Total SBR Time: **5.5 Hours**

I feel like I was **BACK TO HAPPY**

It was over 11 hours if I include walking and mobility.  This week off work was nice and despite [Boxing Day](javascript:flick('sun');), this was my most productive training week in months.  My left lumber was sore though I managed it well.

Winter weather with below zero temperatures and snow that stuck.

The pool was open but the swim was a miss.

My back feels better today but I did sleep in and missed my window to get to the pool.  In its place, I walked for 90 minutes to to the top of [Christmas Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);) with Carina.

After dinner, I did an hour long, Bodyweight Warrior mobility session.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 45 minutes easy.

Run 55-65 minutes easy w/ your buddies

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 Minutes**

Snow shovelled.  Cleared the 4" that fell overnight.

I did a short mobility routine before the run; the idea being to clear any stiffness that might have set in from this morning's shovelling.

The roads, sidewalks, bike path and trail around _Swan Lake_ were covered with different degrees of packed snow and ice.  Traction was solved by some well placed sheet metal screws into an old pair of trainers.  I did feel a bit worked as the softer snow had the effect as running in soft sand.  This run put me over **1200 km** for the year.

I rode the rollers in the basement suite and had a bit of the run coverage from _Kona 2014_ on the TV.  Effort was easy.

This was the **best day of training in a long time** and it felt good to get it done before dinner.

### NOTES
Run Time: **31 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **1650m**

More shovelling this morning and the snow was heavier too.

Made it to _Crystal Pool_ for the swim workout; Carina came with me too.  This felt like a regular workout except the lifeguards pulled the ropes for the 50m lanes before I could finish the 6x150 set so I stopped the activity on my watch, reconfigured it for 25m and effectively did a cool down for what I thought was the balance.

I did the ~30 minute run even though this was changed to a walk (read the updated email late).  Everything felt good; easy pace just in the neighbourhood on the hard packed, unplowed roads.

Lower back is a bit better again this morning (stiff but not precarious).  No niggles from running yesterday either.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Run: Lower back exercises/Breathing.  
Run 45 minutes. Whatever is the best footing you can find.

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes**

I moved more snow in the morning (suite, path to the garage, etc).

The run was on the _Goose_ out to _Eaton Avenue_ and back.  Pretty basic run.  The wind was cold, the bike path was 99% clean; I had moments were I felt light and moments where I felt heavy.

Mobility completed too.  Good end of the week, good start of the year.
