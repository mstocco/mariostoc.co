**26** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL

Easy run on the dirt paths of _Cuthbert Holmes Park_.  Found the [fish trap](javascript:flkty.select(2);) used to count the salmon in the creek; the higher water flow over the grated walkway caught a tiny cutthroat trout.  I picked the poor fellow up and placed it back in the stream.  My last act of random kindness for 2022.
