Sleep **2** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&midast; flipped from [yesterday](challenge2023-22weeksout?sat)

**Dead bugs, breathing, glute bridges.**  
Trainer ~ 30-45 minutes. EASY effort. Keep the HR low. 
Breaking a sweat is ok, but under no circumstance should this feel harder than a walk.

Stretching 22 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Mins** &nbsp; Avg HR: **105 BPM**

Hit the trainer at halftime of the Chief/Bengals game.  Pedalled easy for 45 minutes; everything felt normal with zero ill-effects.

Stretched afterwards (much needed).  My back (QL/right side) was acting in a bad way; it felt like it would go into a full spasm if I wasn't careful. It didn't.  
&rarr;Extra water before going to bed.

Hint of a headache (just a 2 out of 10) and a nagging, occasional dry cough are the final holdout symptoms from last week.

My back is feeling less precarious this morning.

Walked with Carina but just 35 minutes and not the full hour.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Bike: Dead bugs, breathing, and glute bridges.

Trainer ~ 60 minutes. Easy effort. Just spin the legs. Nothing more than that!

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **128W**

Still congested this morning, still bothered by this weird cough.

I set an alarm on my head unit to warn at 120BPM, then set the simulated grade to 0% (level road) and spun my legs for an hour.  Got the beep a couple times and backed off a touch.  Felt pretty good.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Swim: Dead bugs, breathing, and glute bridges.

2x 50 EASY to cool down.

2nd: Run 25 minutes EASY

### NOTES
Total Time: **67 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **1800m** &nbsp;Run: **4.7 km**

A lot less congested upon waking but that nag of a cough persists.

Back to the scene of the crime; it was a bit weird being at _Crystal Pool_.
<!----->
It's been a while since I've swam on a Wednesday afternoon and at 4pm, the kids programs take up all but one lane.  Everyone was moved into the slow lane.  Instead of crawling over people, I called it with 200m to go.

What I missed in the pool, I added on the run.  I **felt good** on the path down to the _Selkirk Trestle_.   Carina kept me company, riding with me on her bike commute home.  This was written as all-caps EASY but I felt like going faster; did the last half building to a strong finish.

#### RUN PACE CHART
![Run](/assets/jpg/run-20230201.jpeg) 
The effort was enough for Garmin to estimate my Lactate Threshold at 155 bpm and 5:03 /km.  **Identical to this time last year**.  This estimated metric last peaked in April of last year.

With the bit of intensity to during the run [yesterday](javascript:flick('wed');), today was going to be interesting.  Good news this morning; congestion is less, the weird cough is still there but **no other ill effects**.

Muscles are a bit, DOMS like stiff, shoulders (swim) and mostly quads (run).
