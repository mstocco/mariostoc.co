# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, March 12, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**15** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
&mdash;

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **11.3 Hours**

I feel like I was **PLAYING CATCH UP**

Missed [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) even my effort to journal was on the back foot to start the week.

A couple of snappy runs plus one on tired legs, focused efforts in the pool and a new trail explored on the mountain bike highlighted this week.

The weather is turning more spring-like but still on the cool side.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 30 minutes EASY.

3rd: Ride 2:30 on the MTB. 
Good day to head down the Goose, Lochside, or the Great Trail. 
Keep the effort easy. Legs might be pretty tired from running back-to-back. So we want to keep the muscle load relativley low. 
Remember to eat and drink early.
Stay Warm.  Have fun.

Weather sucked, and before I could pull my head out of the computer code, it was 7pm.

No training but I did write an RSVP website for the wedding.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2900: 
2 rounds (100 easy free, 100 easy w/ buoy, 50 steady kick. Rest as needed)
6x 100 aerobic/smooth w/ Strong final 25 meters on each rep. R :20 after each.

### NOTES
Time: **135 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **2950m** &nbsp;Run: **11.7 km**

Pretty good swim although I didn't get to the pool quick enough to get it all done in LCM; 2000m in the long format.  The break in between the lane change was ~4 minutes and I swam an extra easy 50m before restarting the workout for the remaining 900m.

I drove to the pool and ran outside in the sunshine.  Summit Park is close and I did 3 trips up the steep section of Summit Ave, 3 trips up The Rise and 3 trips the length of Topaz.  I missed hitting start on the watch; this was ~700m longer than recorded on Garmin.  I **felt ready good** and had a runner's high through to bedtime.

## WEDNESDAY MAR 15 üå§
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:45 on the MTB. 
Get yourself outside. 
No "intervals" but.....goal is to warm up over to your favorite hill.. (as long as you enjoy the descent, it is ok with me) 
And ride about 1 hour going up and down the same climb. Solid effort. No specific pace, just "climbing on a MTB" pace. 
You should be a touch out of breathe, but also in control and able to go harder at any time. 
Remember to bring some calories and to drink. Even if it's cold and weight! 

Hopefully you can have some fun with this session.

### NOTES
Moving Time: **105 Mins**  &nbsp; Accent: **550m**

I think I may have read this wrong and just went up to the top of Stewart Mountain on my MTB.  I stopped part way up to take off my jacket/glasses/etc and had enough of a rest that I cleared a rocky section that had me pushing the bike up every other time.

From the top, I took Tom's Trail for the first time off the hill.  Trail Forks has it listed as black, the new CRD signage has it as blue.  Regardless, I explored this route carefully; not the time of the year to fall on that terrain.   

This was a fun ride.  I considered taking the TT bike off the trainer but the air is still too cold when an MTB ride is an option.

## THURSDAY MAR 16 üå§
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2100: 
200 easy swim. 
2x 50 shark-fin drill. 
100 smooth w/ focus on rotation. 
2x 50 Paddle-fist drill. 
100 smooth w/ focus on wrist below elbow. 
6x 50 Descend 1-3, 4-6 1: IM effort, 2: ¬Ω IM effort, 3: 1k effort. R :15 after each. 
100 EASY. 
800 meters @ ¬Ω IM effort/focus. Should be a solid push, but you'd still have 1100 to go in a race. So no dying for air when you're done! 
6x 50 super easy to stretch out and cool down.

Run is NOT to/from the pool. Unless you get driven to the pool and run the long way home. 
Pre-Run: Dead bugs, breathing, Glute Bridges.....and :45 Normal Plank, and :45 on each side for side plank. Keep your hips level and your rips/hips connected. Just like on the dead bugs.
Run 60 minutes. Easy effort. Hilly route. Remember food/water. Especially if you're running after swimming

### NOTES
Time: **105 Mins** &nbsp; Swim: **2100m** &nbsp; Run: **10.4 km**

A better sleep last night but the knot in my trap is still aggravated.

Got the workout done just before the ropes were moved from 50m to 25m.  I found a groove on the 12th of 16 lengths (800m rep); I wish I could have held on to that groove longer.

I ran south of the pool this afternoon with the goals of getting in some hills, keeping it easy and drawing a GPS track that never intersects.  Got all three goals checked off and I **felt really good** in doing so.

### NOTES
Time: **103 Mins** &nbsp;Run: **8 km** &nbsp;Swim: **2500m**

I felt good in the water this afternoon.  50m lane format so the rhythm of the 12x sets wasn't broken up by a wall.  I plugged the workout into the Garmin incorrectly but did swim the workout as written.

The jog home on the other hand was a real chore.  All except for a couple minutes was heavy legs.
