Fueling and hydration as usual.   
Mobility 25 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **15 km** 

Rain, chores and ants.  It was a busy day before lacing up the shoes.

Lots of fatigue in my quads so I just took it easy and stayed on a mostly flat route.  I got as comfortable as I could with a pretty steady, 129 BPM and spent time on my feet.  I was back to the start with 5 minutes still on the clock but given how I felt, pressed the stop button, and was happy with the time.

Lumbar was stiff but not bothered by the run.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim **2600m**

Stiff lumbar this morning; I noticed it during the swim but not enough to not swim.  On paper, I was expecting a "harder to follow" workout but I got into a groove and got the work in.  The 5x100m were particularly good because I stuck to the written effort for every one; slower times on a few were just pushing off the wall late because of lane congestion.

Spent time with a hot tub jet on my back just because it was there.  I could feel my left ankle from the run too.
