# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, February 26, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**17** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Get to the niggles before the niggles get to me.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **11 Hours** <small>(and 15 seconds)</small>

I feel like I was **CONSISTENT**

My goal of managing the niggles was _almost_ accomplished.
I worked through the hip flexor and [a rhomboid flare up](javascript:flick('fri');)
but the very challenging knot in my leg glute is as stubborn 
as I am. That niggle will be carried over to [next week](challenge2023-16weeksout).

This is the first week that I can confidently say **COVID is in 
my rearview mirror**.

The weather has been colder than normal; we had snow on 
[Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');) and hail on [Thursday](javascript:flick('thu');). 

Hard to imagine I'll be in a lake in a few months.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Pre-Bike: Dead bugs, Glute Bridges.  
Ride 80 minutes easy. Just spin. Trainer or rollers. Whatever 
sounds fun.

2nd: Run 50 minutes EASY. Ideally this is off the bike. But 
whatever works with the schedule works with me.

### NOTES
Total Time: **130 Mins** &nbsp; Run: **8km** &nbsp; NP: **118W**

Wedding expo first, then the run, then the spin.

Impending weather and daylight was my motivation to run first. 
My **legs felt heavy** right away; no choice but to run easy 
up to [Panama Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);) and back. 
I had a gel ~30 minutes in.

I was on the trainer shortly after; **tired legs** for this 
activity too.  I had a bottle with 70g of carb mix consumed in 
the first hour, and just water for the last 20 minutes.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Run: Dead bugs, breathing, and Glute Bridges.
Run 60 minutes EASY. 

Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **62 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **10.2 km**

Not the most restful sleep last night.  Regardless, everything 
is just a **little bit better** today.

Shovelled some heavy snow before work then late this afternoon, 
I went for the easy run.

What a difference from [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');). 
Practically the same route, same time of day, same kind of 
weather, except today, everything felt far more **comfortable**. 
I could still feel the knot in my left glute and there is some 
soreness in my right talo-navicular joint. Regardless, for a 
regular, base run, I finished it with a big smile.
<!----->
Reviewing the activity afterwards, I would have guessed that 
my pace was quicker than it was.  No matter, my focus was 
running with good posture, not going fast.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Bike: Dead bugs, Glute Bridges.

Trainer 95 minutes: Remember to hydrate and fuel!
15 minutes easy spinning to warm up.
8x :30 moderate standing, getting out of the saddle to loosen up, :45 seated/normal riding.
5 minutes easy spinning.
6x 1:00 high cadence/stable hips, 1:30 easy spinning after each.
3 extra minutes easy spinning.
5x 6 minutes @ what feels like 1 gear easier than a 60 minute effort (aka: Find 60 minute effort..then drop it a gear easier and tick away) 2 minutes easy after each rep.
7 minutes easy spinning to cool down.

### NOTES
Time: **94 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **137W**

Awake at 0400.  Fortunately, I was able to get another hour of 
sleep after a while.

Back on the trainer late in the afternoon.
<!----->
I need to remember the order in which to turn on the electronics 
to get the right device to control the _"smart trainer"_.

Dead bugs and glute bridges first as I can still feel that 
left hip flexor not as strong/healthy as it should be.  Once 
pedalling, it is not bothered.

I continued with the 2019 coverage of _Challenge Roth_ on 
YouTube.  The top men have started the run; LCB has crested 
_Solar Hill_ on her final lap.

I lost a minute of saddle time for a bio-break.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

300 easy swimming to loosen up. 
2x 50 shark-fin drill. R :20. 
200 aerobic w/ focus on rotation. 
2x 50 paddle-fist drill. R :20.

50 super easy.

200 super easy to cool down. 

Pre-Run: Dead bugs, breathing, and Glute Bridges.
Run 45 minutes EASY. Running home from the pool, on the treadmill, or another time of tday. It all works for me.

### NOTES
Time: **108 Mins** &nbsp; Swim(s): **2300m** &nbsp; Run(s): **9 km**

The cough has started to subside and my resting heartrate is 
close to pre-COVID numbers.
<!----->
Commute to the pool on foot for 3.8 km _"warm up"_; I felt 
pretty good; effort was easy. Even a solid hail storm couldn't 
wreck my **good mood**.

---

In the pool, I knew I only had a limited amount of time with 
the 50m lanes in.  I made the most of it and got through to 
the end of the 9x50m descend set.  **Effort was good**, focus 
was on point.  My friend Batuhan was in the lane beside me and 
that helped with the motivation.

I hopped out and re-worked the workout in my watch to work 
with the 25m lanes.  It wasn't long before I was back in the 
water to do the hard 50m set.  Even the shorter lengths 
couldn't help me from **feeling gassed** on the hard efforts.

---

On the longer jog home, I dealt with a side stitch for the 
longest time.  It eventually passed and the final kilometres 
were **easy and rhythmic**.

---

Although the 2 workouts were broken up over 4 activities, this 
was a solid afternoon.   My left hip complex finished up ok.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Ride: Dead bugs, Glute Bridges.

Trainer 80 minutes: 
20 minutes easy spinning to warm up.

5x 2:00 big gear/low cadence/high torque...again, no watt range, just ride to feel tension on the pedals and a comfortable position. 2:00 easy spinning after each. 
10 minutes easy spinning to cool down. 

Mobility 18 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **143W**

Just as I am about to get ahead of one niggle (left hip) 
another pops up.

I woke up this morning with an angry rhomboid major (right 
side); it stayed that way all day.
<!----->
Fortunately, that rhomboid isn't needed much while turning my 
legs over on the trainer.

I rode the workout **exactly as written**, non-ERG mode, 
holding 120 RPM on the first rounds and averaging 50 RPM on 
the big gear reps.

This felt like a base level workout.

### 80 MINUTES 
![Bike](/assets/jpg/bike-20230303.jpeg)

On the big screen, I continued with the 2019 Roth coverage.
The men's leader has turned off the canal and is making his 
way back to town.  The race clock following him was ~06:45:00; 
so depending on the start wave I am assigned in June, I may 
not see the men's race leader on the run course. üòï

<!----->
### NOTES
Time: **120 Mins** &nbsp; Swim: **2800m** &nbsp; Run: **9.4 km**

_Crystal Pool_ at a time when the lanes change broke up the 
swim [again](javascript:flick('thu');).  This time I was at 
the 2000m mark of the workout; I may have called it good 
enough if I was pressed for time.

Like [Thursday](javascript:flick('thu');), the staff were 
quick with the ropes and I was quickly back in the water with a 
reprogrammed watch for the balance of the workout...  plus a 
bit more.

I am glad that I kept going because I had four of the 250m 
reps done in the 25m lane with 2 to go in the 50m lane.  

Those first four 250m reps, short course reps were **super 
consistent**; stopping the watch with at 4:43.5, &nbsp;4:43.5, 
&nbsp;4:41.5 and 4:43.8.

The remaining 250m reps done in the long course lane were 
4:40.0 and 4:39.6.

The perceived effort stayed the same.
I was **really stoked** to finish the swim this way. 
<!----->
Who would have guessed that 3.5 seconds would bring me so much 
joy on a Saturday afternoon?

---

The run was a **super easy pace** north on my regular gravel 
route, turning around at 30 minutes and in keeping with the 
consistancy theme from the pool, I returned to my start point, 
7 seconds ahead of making it a perfect split.  

I realized after the fact that this was to be a 65 minute run. 
Hopefully the extra 200m in the pool makes it a wash.

---

My **left glute max is sore**.  That knot is angry.  Everything else 
feels like it is in good working order.
