# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, September 6, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(3);)

**51 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
To build on the good feeling that I had after getting back at it late last week.

## SUMMARY
I feel like I was **BUILDING CONSISTENCY** during the first half 
of the week but unfortunately **STRUGGLED** with the same on the 
back half of the week.

With Sunday’s run and Wednesday’s brick workout, I am feeling 
a lot better about the direction I am heading in. The back 
half of this week (Saturday and Friday) serve as a big 
reminder for me to get the work in when I can; mother nature 
decided to blanket this area with wildfire smoke from Oregon, 
derailling a run and a bike ride.

My coach expressed that skipping mobility, like I did these 
past two weeks, is *not the best plan of action* long term.

## SUNDAY SEP 06
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 50 minutes, rolling route, easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **55 minutes**

I thought I'd do my old Vanalman route but the city has a 
connecting trail closed so I was left to improvise a route. 
I made my way towards Christmas Hill and did a half lap of 
Swan  Lake.  Pace was easy and this was the right length of 
time for me to have been on my feet.  I was feeling it on 
the uphills but finished feeling strong on the last km.

Run Distance: **9.5 km**

## MONDAY SEP 07
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 22 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Good sleep last night but I do have a touch of fatigue in my 
legs (feels good).

Today may have been a break from a scheduled workout but I was 
active finishing the siding project that I had on the go. 
That is one thing off the plate and will allow me a bit more 
free time to get some training in.

## TUESDAY SEP 08
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes.  
Run 30 minutes, flatter route, easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

I didn’t sleep as well as I would have liked; I am guessing 
that it was the sawdust from yesterday’s work on the shed.  I 
did have my run kit ready to go for a pre-coffee easy run but 
I put it off until later; the skys are thick with wildfire 
smoke from Eastern WA.

The smoke cleared a bit after work so I did a lap of Swan Lake. 
The first 7 minutes sucked with heavy legs (calves, soleus in 
particular) but I did find a groove after that and finished 
feeling strong.  I mostly breathed through my nose to limit 
the effort with the lingering smoke in the air.

## WEDNESDAY SEP 09
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes, easy and keep it fun.  
Run 30 minutes OTB, easy pace.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I feel  like I slept better last night and I had a good day at 
work. In fact, I wish I could have a day like today _every day_. 
Yesterday's smoke cleared and the weather couldn't have been 
better.  25&#8451; and sunny and it felt like Maui in December.

The stipulation for the ride was _"fun"_; which rhymes with 
_"Munn"_ except Prospect Lake Road was the much better option. 
The first few pedal strokes on the bike felt laboured but I 
soon found a groove and the ride ended up feeling good to 
great overall. Coming down Hampton Road, I got out of my shoes 
and nailed a dismount in the driveway.

<!---->
Off the bike, I went right into my Nikes, stuffed the bike in 
the garage and headed off to Lochside Trail toward Quadra 
Street. I didn't feel much of the typical jelly legs coming 
off the bike but I certainly _did_ feel yesterday's run. That 
feeling of fatigue was greatest at the top of the Switch 
Bridge and didn't subside until the last 5 minutes; things 
went from sucking pretty bad to actually feeling strong.
 
I suprised myself with a **5:30/km** average pace.

I had a good vegetarian dinner and it is now time for bed.

Ride Distance: **24.90 km** &nbsp; Elevation: **284 m**

## THURSDAY SEP 10

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes

### NOTES

I did not sleep that well (should have gone to bed earlier). 
The legs felt stiff (not sore) in the morning but after working 
mostly from the standing desk today, I feel pretty good.

## FRIDAY SEP 11
<mark> Sleep **6** </mark>| Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 40 minutes: 20 minutes easy, 8x :30 strides, :45 jog after 
each, 10 minutes easy to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Very late night doing a system update for work had me going to 
bed after 1am and I was awaken with a bout of sadness (missing 
my dad sucks, even in the middle of the night).  This is the 
second night of not much sleep.

The forest fire smoke is back and as thick as it was on Tuesday 
morning.  Hoping that the typical afternoon winds of the Juan de 
Fuca would clear the air out, didn’t happen; it is even 
noticibly cooler as less sunlight is getting through.

I know the strides are important but I am feeling exhausted and 
going to bed early tonight.

## SATURDAY SEP 12
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:00. Road bike. Hilly route. Heading out west is great.   
Have fun. Remember to eat and drink.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I am starting this day after having a restful sleep _(finally)_.  The wildfire 
smoke may be worse than yesterday.  I haven’t put the engery into a 
mobility routine since my reset and although one isn’t on the schedule 
today, it is Saturday and I have the time to stretch out.
