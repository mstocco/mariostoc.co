<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, breathing, glute bridges.

Ride 3:00 on the MTB. 
Route is up to you. 
Solving for....warm, fun, well fueled, well hydrated. 
Effort is easy to steady. I imagine you'll be pretty tired at the end, and that is OK! 

### NOTES
Moving Time: **197 Minutes** &nbsp; Elevation:  **960m** 

Storm warning and the skies started to get dark just as I 
headed out for today's ride.  

I pedalled easier than my recent efforts to the gate at the 
end of _Westoby Road_.  After a quick rip on _Comfy Wooden 
Chair_, I headed up hill for another crack at _Kallie's Korner_.

I almost cleaned it too!  One tricky bit and one dab. I 
reached _Munn Road_ with a huge smile and here is where I 
decided to go explore...
<!----->
Instead of riding down _Munn_ again, I turned on to a fire 
road called _Corey Road Connector_.  This eventually put me 
in the north-west end of the _Mount Work Bike Park_; an entire 
section of the bike park that is new to me.

_Bubble Wrap_, a single **black diamond trail** was my only option 
before finding blue trails in my comfort zone. This bit of trail
wasn't too gnarly but a wet root did put me on the ground fast. 
My left wrist is going to be sore [tomorrow](javascript:flick('mon');).

I stopped whenever I needed to check the _Trail Forks_ app on 
my iPhone. I made my way to _Regional Trail North_; a familiar 
fire road to me.

Finally the **blue trails**. _Centerfold_ to _Painless_; I 
cleaned the entire trail.  That put me at the top of _Fun 
Trail_.  _Sofa King_, _Bottom Feeder_ and _Shock Treatment_ 
made up the time in the park go by fast.  I exited the park 
via _Executive West_ and headed for home.

Overall, a **fun ride**.  I'd do that route again.
