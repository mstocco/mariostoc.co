### NOTES

Despite a good sleep last night, I  have a niggle in my right ankle; why now?  I haven't run since [last Tuesday](ironman2022-30weeksout?tue).  I worked on it with a compression band and by the afternoon, I forget there was even something there.

I headed out for the run late in the day, with the idea to get the [last Sunday](ironman2022-30weeksout?sun) run completed with four _continuous_ laps of _Swan Lake_.  Doable but based on the fatigue in my legs, it was going to be a slog.  
<!---->
I had signs of comfort on the third lap and on the last leg of the fourth, I was feeling pretty good. 

I noticed that a small blister formed on my right foot (behind the ball of my foot); that has not happened in a long time.

### NOTES

My **right ankle** is pretty lit up this morning; it's not happy bearing my full weight.

After a banana, I got kitted up for the forecasted rain that didn't fall.  Steady to sweaty push on the 11 minute ride to the pool (Rocky Mountain).  I was warmed up before getting into the water.
<!---->
In the water, I noticed on the first 200m that my lats were tired.  I am pretty sure that is a _"good thing&trade;"_.

When the 0615 swim club squeezed everyone into remaining lanes, things got pretty **congested**.  Normally, it doesn't take long for the reduced lanes to shake out into their respective abilities but this morning was different.  It was hard to leave on time during the 24x50m set and I had to find a balance between being assertive and understanding that it wasn't that long ago that I was the guy being crawled over.

Keeping it real though, the swim club in the next lane were swimming with one arm at my 1500m effort.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 20 minutes. In theory, this would be nice to start the day. Keep it EASY.

Pm: Run w/ buddies. About 9k-11k. Easy to start....a bit of a pickup to finish over the last few K's. 100% ok if the run is entirely easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **92 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **12.1 km** @**5:37/km**

Oddly, my right ankle was **not sore** this morning but my head was, at least until breakfast.

Just Vincent and me for today's run.  By the numbers (pace, cadence, GCT), this was a good run for where I am currently.  By feel, this was a **great run**; my running partner kept me honest for the entire hour plus.

Easy spin on the rollers afterwards.  A little fatigue in my calves &larr;bliss.
