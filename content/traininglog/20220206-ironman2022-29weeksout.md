### PLANNED WORKOUT

Mobility 26 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **86 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **13 km**

Despite a good sleep last night, I  have a niggle in my right ankle; why now?  I haven't run since [last Tuesday](ironman2022-30weeksout?tue).  I worked on it with a compression band and by the afternoon, I forget there was even something there.

I headed out for the run late in the day, with the idea to get the [last Sunday](ironman2022-30weeksout?sun) run completed with four _continuous_ laps of _Swan Lake_.  Doable but based on the fatigue in my legs, it was going to be a slog.  
<!---->
I had signs of comfort on the third lap and on the last leg of the fourth, I was feeling pretty good. 

I noticed that a small blister formed on my right foot (behind the ball of my foot); that has not happened in a long time.

### NOTES
Total Time: **61 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2400m**

My **right ankle** is pretty lit up this morning; it's not happy bearing my full weight.

After a banana, I got kitted up for the forecasted rain that didn't fall.  Steady to sweaty push on the 11 minute ride to the pool (Rocky Mountain).  I was warmed up before getting into the water.
<!---->
In the water, I noticed on the first 200m that my lats were tired.  I am pretty sure that is a _"good thing&trade;"_.

When the 0615 swim club squeezed everyone into remaining lanes, things got pretty **congested**.  Normally, it doesn't take long for the reduced lanes to shake out into their respective abilities but this morning was different.  It was hard to leave on time during the 24x50m set and I had to find a balance between being assertive and understanding that it wasn't that long ago that I was the guy being crawled over.

Keeping it real though, the swim club in the next lane were swimming with one arm at my 1500m effort.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 20 minutes. In theory, this would be nice to start the day. Keep it EASY.

Pm: Run w/ buddies. About 9k-11k. Easy to start, a bit of a pickup to finish over the last few K's. 100% ok if the run is entirely easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **92 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **12.1 km** @5:37/km

Oddly, my right ankle was **not sore** this morning but my head was, at least until breakfast.

Just Vincent and me for today's run.  By the numbers (pace, cadence, GCT), this was a good run for where I am currently.  By feel, this was a **great run**; my running partner kept me honest for the entire hour plus.

Easy spin on the rollers afterwards.  A little fatigue in my calves &larr;bliss.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers 85 minutes: 
20 minutes easy spinning to warm up. 
10x :20 high cadence, :40 easy. 5 minutes easy spinning. Then....
8x 3:00 @ 30-45 minute TT effort, 2:00 easy spin after each. 
10 minutes easy spinning to cool down.

Walk ~ 20-30 minutes. Either to start or end the day. Just a walk. Nothing hard.

### NOTES
Total Time: **85 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **rollers/road bike**

A nice, restful sleep last night.  The walk was behind the mower as it is February in Victoria and the grass needed tending to.

I contemplated switching the rollers out for a spin up to _Thetis_ on the MTB but time (daylight) wasn't on my side.  Regardless, the workout was ridden to plan and I feel like I got an honest workout completed.

### Tomorrow's Run Today
Lucky me.  Yauki sends a "let's run" text while I was on my weekly with Elliot.  I got a green light for 40 minutes and at 1600, shoes were on and I was out the door to meet the Tuesday Night Crew on a Thursday.

Nice and simple out and back on _The Goose_.  I was feeling fatigue in my quads to start but after a mile or so, I fell into a nice groove @5:44/km pace.

I am not sure how my request for an easy 40 minutes got stretched to 8km and a 1 km build from _Seaton_ to the top of the _Switch Bridge_.  First to crest the bridge but I didn't run the downhill.

![Run](/assets/jpg/run-20220210.jpeg)
Having this kind of a day, swimming, biking and a run is what **I am thankful** for.

### NOTES
Total Time: **300 Minutes**  
Ride Elevation: **~700m**  &nbsp; Swim: **1900m**

Chores and the finishing the pruning work on our fig tree meant a late start to the ride.  What a ride though.  I picked a route that proved to add a lot of training stimulus last summer; _Thetis Park_ to _Kallie's Connector_ exiting near the top of _Munn Road_.

For good measure, I had a pretty clean run on _Comfy Wooden Chair_ before the slog up the fire road to _Kallie's Connector_; even with the detour, I was on schedule to the start of the connector trail (one hour even).  I had another good, mostly clean run on _Kallie's Connector_.  

Rolling down _Munn Road_ (cool to cold), I turned left on _Woodridge Place_ and entered [Mount Work Regional Park](javascript:flkty.select(2);) for a bit more trail exploration.  

_Fun Trail_ up to _Bottom Feeder_, to _Cross Over_ to some fire roads before my standard exit to the park _Executive West_.  All blue trails, all done comfortably (stoked).

I was getting short on time so it was a bee-line home on the shoulder of _Interurban Road_.

90g bottle and an a banana consumed on the bike and I mixed a second bottle for the pool.

Getting into the pool, I realized that I left my watch (and the programmed workout) at home.  No biggie as I was pretty confident that I had the workout memorized and that I could use the clock(s) on the walls.  I feel good in the water and really good with the execution of the workout.
