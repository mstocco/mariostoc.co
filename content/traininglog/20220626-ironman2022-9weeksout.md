<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ideally these will all be in order. The gap between the workouts is all up to you.   
Open Water swim: 
5 minutes easy swimming to warm up/get loose. Stretch out as needed. 
When ready...
3x 15 minutes continuous/steady/swimming straight. Ideally picking points to swim between so you can see how straight you're swimming. Focus is on a continuous rhythm. Something around Ironman effort is appropriate. 
R 3:00 between each. 
Short 2-4 minutes easy swimming between each.    
Ride 1:30 on TT bike. In the bars as much as is comfortable.    
Run/Walk 60 minutes: 
10 minutes walking to loosen up.
10x 3 minutes easy running, 1 minute walking after each. 
10 minutes walking to cool down.

### NOTES

Horrible night last night.  Multiple bathroom breaks, night sweats, bit of a head-ache and a bad case of diarrhea to start the day.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Off S/B/R.  
Pilates 14 minutes (Do some dead bugs before/after this) I'm hoping this is somewhat too easy. I'd rather it be too easy than too hard. Mostly you're here to listen to his instruction and cueing. 

Mobility 30 minutes (You can skip the first split test, we're just here for the stretching) 

### NOTES

I was nearing the overpass at _Royal Oak_ while on my way to the lake for a swim when work called me back for an emergency.  I turned around and was not finished until 2300.  Grrrrr...

My scalenes and traps are incredibly sore today.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Walk 60 minutes. If the foot is MUCH improved....then you can turn 20 minutes of this into easy running. Otherwise, you're just out for a walk. 

Pre-Ride: Dead bugs.   
Ride 90 minute easy. TT bike. 
Try to get 30-40 minutes in the bars....mostly continuous. Overall an easy to steady effort, but trying to get dialed into the position.

### NOTES
Total: **150 mins** &nbsp; Run: **6.7 km** &nbsp; Ride: **90 mins** 

First real day of the week and I feel pretty good.  Did 41 minutes of easy running without a great deal of pain.  Did 30 minutes of continuous, focused, aero bar work on the rollers before heading outside.  Worst part of the day was getting a flat.  Time for new rubber.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

Very short swim to stretch out and cool down at the end. 
Pre-Ride: Dead Bugs
2nd: 3:00: 
Hilly MTB....You can ride on the Great Trail, Goose and take a few few side roads/trails to get in some extra dirt, or you can ride trails and get in a good amount of vertical that way. 
Either way, the only effort is "Get up the hill" and choose a hilly route. 
Remember to eat and hydrate. It's after a longer swim and overall it's a big day.
