### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** &nbsp; Trainer: **116 W NP**

Right ankle is bothered from [yesterday's jog](challenge2023-34weeksout?sat).

I plugged in the workout into my Garmin Edge with a primary (cadence) and secondary (power) target set for the 30 second reps.  Unfortunately, just the cadence was used and the trainer dumped the resistance during those 30 second periods.  I stayed in the aerobars and spun as fast and smooth as I could.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Breathing and deadbugs before the pool.**

6x 50 easy swimming to warm up. Rest as needed. 
4x 50 kick gradual descend 1-4 r :20. 
100 easy swim. 
6x 50 Swim and Descend 1-3, 4-6. R :20 after each.

### NOTES
Total Time: **51 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim **2100m**

Snow in the forecast and snow in the air (not sticking); I drove to/from the pool.

Did a lot more bilateral breathing (just because).  I wore my HRM Swim strap to get a better read on my heart-rate.  It represents my effort on the descending reps better than the minuscule difference in time/pace.

10 minutes of walking to warm up.

### NOTES

Did some "Jane Fondas" along with the dead bugs before heading out the door.

Windy and cold but the sun was out long enough to get rid of the snow.

Walked for a bit before some comfortable running.  A slightly different loop north of _Panama Flats_; practically the same route as [Saturday](challenge2023-34weeksout?sat) and my right ankle felt better this afternoon.

Another dog incident on the trail again; I think I will try a different time of day next time.
