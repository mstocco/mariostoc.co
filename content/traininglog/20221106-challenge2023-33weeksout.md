### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** &nbsp; Trainer: **116 W NP**

Right ankle is bothered from [yesterday's jog](challenge2023-34weeksout?sat).

I plugged in the workout into my Garmin Edge with a primary (cadence) and secondary (power) target set for the 30 second reps.  Unfortunately, just the cadence was used and the trainer dumped the resistance during those 30 second periods.  I stayed in the aerobars and spun as fast and smooth as I could.

Snow in the forecast and snow in the air (not sticking); I drove to/from the pool.

Did a lot more bilateral breathing (just because).  I wore my HRM Swim strap to get a better read on my heart-rate.  It represents my effort on the descending reps better than the minuscule difference in time/pace.

Did some "Jane Fondas" along with the dead bugs before heading out the door.

Windy and cold but the sun was out long enough to get rid of the snow.

Walked for a bit before some comfortable running.  A slightly different loop north of _Panama Flats_; practically the same route as [Saturday](challenge2023-34weeksout?sat) and my **right ankle felt better** this afternoon.

Another dog incident on the trail again; I think I will try a different time of day next time.
