### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** &nbsp; Trainer: **116 W NP**

Right ankle is bothered from [yesterday's jog](challenge2023-34weeksout?sat).

I plugged in the workout into my Garmin Edge with a primary (cadence) and secondary (power) target set for the 30 second reps.  Unfortunately, just the cadence was used and the trainer dumped the resistance during those 30 second periods.  I stayed in the aerobars and spun as fast and smooth as I could.

### NOTES
Total Time: **51 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim **2100m**

Snow in the forecast and snow in the air (not sticking); I drove to/from the pool.

Did a lot more bilateral breathing (just because).  I wore my HRM Swim strap to get a better read on my heart-rate.  It represents my effort on the descending reps better than the minuscule difference in time/pace.
