# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, May 14, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**6** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
The week before getting **married**!

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **9&14frac; Hours**

I feel like I was **CELEBRATING LIFE**

Training tapered off as the week ended.  Lots going on with the wedding, staying focused and managing any life stress better than I may have ever done.

Bike ride on [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');) was the training highlight of the week and I felt great.

Hint of a headache most of today, might be related to too much sun [yesterday](challenge2023-7weeksout?sat), or the onset of seasonal hay-fever, or who knows...
<!----->
I rode the TT Bike up to _Sidney_ for a Mother's Day Lunch with the family.  I expected my legs to feel worse though I did intentionally start slow and built into the ride before heading north on the _Pat Bay Highway_.  A slight headwind was partially negated by the highway traffic.

Carina dropped me off at _Commonwealth Pool_ for the swim workout.  I completed it as written though the amount of steps were too great for Garmin to handle in one activity.  The ladder up to 300m sort of dragged but the steps from the second 300 back down felt better.

I rode home via _Wilkinson_ and _Interurban Roads_.

Super busy day with work and wedding stuff.  The weather was really hot too.

I finally headed out for a twilight walk/jog at 2030.  I figured that I'd get a bit of walking and a couple of the reps done but once I got going, I ended up completing all 15 minutes.  I felt good.  My feet (plural) felt ok and no soreness around the injury site on my right foot.  A bit of very minor navicular soreness, left and right; pretty normal.

Despite a late evening walk/jog, I woke feeling refreshed.  Nice!
<!----->
Good intentions on getting to the pool early were dashed and I swam this activity split between a 50m and 25m lane.  Zero congestion in the lanes though.

My energy was just okay to start.  The kickboard rep continues to get better; hip flexors felt the last 15m.  At one point, I forgot to switch from exaggerated rotation to high turnover halfway down the pool.  The 3x50m efforts were better.  I did the first of them in the 50m lane, the last 5 rounds in the 25m lane.

I had an errand to run in Oak Bay so I rode in that direction for the long way home spin.  I was on the mountain bike this afternoon and despite just getting out of the pool, I felt really good.  Not like I remember long rides home from the pool a year ago.

Right foot is a bit sore this morning.  Not a üö© just stiffness that I might feel if I had lots of run volume.  Probably the kick set [yesterday](javascript:flick('tue');).

High altitude forest fire smoke in May is a reminder that future IRONMAN prep might have to be early to mid summer races like this year.  I am curious what type of summer Penticton will experience going forward...
<!----->
Late afternoon roll out of the driveway, straight down _Interurban Road_ to get out to _Willis Point Road_.   Saanich Police had the road blocked off and were administering a breathalyzer test to someone clearly inebriated.  At least for the first two trips up the hill, I was assured that the traffic racing up behind me was sober.

I rode the hill 4 times, turning around at the entrance to the lake.  The last trip up, I kept going over _Ross Durance Road_ then down into _Langford_.

Legs, body, back, **all felt great** the entire ride.  I spent the first 14 minutes upright before dropping into the aerobars, then was in them whenever traffic and terrain permitted.

A few chores before meeting up with Chris G. for a ride up to the gate at _Westoby Road_.  I rode my TT Bike, he was on his gravel bike and hoping to explore the route I took him on earlier this winter.  He continued once we reached the dirt, I headed back down the hill for an easy out and back spin.

The rest of the day was wedding related.  Big day for Carina and I is [tomorrow](challenge2023-5weeksout?sun)!

The (short) lap pool at _The Empress_ was nice to play in (brief, non structured chance to be horizontal in the water).
