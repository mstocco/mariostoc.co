Hint of a headache most of today, might be related to too much sun [yesterday](challenge2023-7weeksout?sat), or the onset of seasonal hay-fever, or who knows...

I rode the TT Bike up to _Sidney_ for a Mother's Day Lunch with the family.  I expected my legs to feel worse though I did intentionally start slow and built into the ride before heading north on the _Pat Bay Highway_.  A slight headwind was partially negated by the highway traffic.

Carina dropped me off at _Commonwealth Pool_ for the swim workout.  I completed it as written though the amount of steps were too great for Garmin to handle in one activity.  The ladder up to 300m sort of dragged but the steps from the second 300 back down felt better.

I rode home via _Wilkinson_ and _Interurban Roads_.

Super busy day with work and wedding stuff.  The weather was really hot too.

I finally headed out for a twilight walk/jog at 2030.  I figured that I'd get a bit of walking and a couple of the reps done but once I got going, I ended up completing all 15 minutes.  I felt good.  My feet (plural) felt ok and no soreness around the injury site on my right foot.  A bit of very minor navicular soreness, left and right; pretty normal.
