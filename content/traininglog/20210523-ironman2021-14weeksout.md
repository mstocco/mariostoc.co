Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 90 minutes. Flat/rolling route. EASY effort. Elk Lake/Goose/Lochside/Waterfront/Panama Flats kind of terrain. 
Stay well fueled. 
2nd: Can be directly after the ride but later in the day will probably be more fun!
Mountain bike 75 minutes. Get outside. Spin the legs a bit. Hit a few trails. Have fun. Main goal is to be on a bike and move the legs. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **135 mins** &nbsp; Run: **16km** &nbsp; Ride: **23km**

Carina dropped me off at Michells Farm and I jogged home from there.  Decent headwind and in sections sheltered from the wind but not the sun, it was quite warm.  I **felt good** but not as fresh as when I did this route back in [January](ironman2021-32weeksout?sun).

With an easier, +3 hour ride [yesterday](ironman2021-15weeksout?sat), I felt less fatigue in my legs compared to a week ago.

#### RUN: Michell Farm to Tillicum

I was invited for dinner with my in-laws so I jumped on the TT bike for a run up to _Sidney_.  The mountain bike is fun but the TT bike can be fun too.  It is rare for me to ride mostly uninterrupted for just ~20km on the road so I took this as a chance to learn and make mental notes of the effort and distance.

Given the headwind experienced on the run a couple hours earlier, I expected to get a push for the ride in the opposite direction.  A decent tailwind through to _Elk Lake_ died off near the intersection of _Island View Road_.  Then it was a slight headwind for the remainder of the ride.

#### RIDE: Uptown to Sidney

Good thing too.  The weather forecast calls for rain all day and I woke with another headache.  My mistake; I don't think I had enough for dinner last night.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Option 1: am: Run, Pm: Ride.   
Option 2: Pm: ride w/ run off.   
Ride 80 minutes. Spin 25-30 minutes easy (Maybe a bit extra on the way out vs back home). (Towards Mill hill) 5x 3:00 #1: Steady climbing to warm up. #2-5 @ a touch easier than 20k effort, 2-3 minutes easy after each. 20-25 minutes easy riding to cool down.  
Run 30 minutes easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 minutes**

Rain in the morning meant "Option 2".

It was a long day on the keyboard and I really did not feel like going for a bike ride.  I would have been ok if there was just a 30 minute run scheduled.  Regardless of how I felt, I pulled the road bide off the wall, lubed the chain and pumped up the tires.

Not long after I set off for the Crystal View subdivision (_Mill Hill_), I noticed an odd, random click coming from the drive train.  I spun around for home and put the bike on my work stand.  My guess is there is a bit of play in the bottom bracket bearings and I can't add anymore preload to adjust it.  This was my winter bike and hasn't seen a real mechanic in a year.

Satisfied that I did my best to solve the noise, I headed back out to get my workout done.

The first run to the top of the subdivision felt easy.  In fact I went to the very top (_Goldstone Heights_) for every rep tonight.  Maybe it was yesterday's day off training but every trip to the top of the hill was easier than I remember from the last time I did a ride here.  After the fifth rep, I did a hard standing effort from the start of the hill to the elementary school for good measure.  I felt strong on the bike this evening.

Off the bike, that strong feeling continued.  The awkward "jelly legs" did not last but a couple of minutes and I clocked almost 32 minutes at my marathon pace with an average heart-rate of just 126 BPM.  I didn't just run the flat bike path either; I ran on Douglas to make it a rolling route instead.

Time for a shower and dinner; it's burritos tonight!
