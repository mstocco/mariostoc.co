### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 90 minutes. Flat/rolling route. EASY effort. Elk Lake/Goose/Lochside/Waterfront/Panama Flats kind of terrain. 
Stay well fueled. 
2nd: Can be directly after the ride but later in the day will probably be more fun!
Mountain bike 75 minutes. Get outside. Spin the legs a bit. Hit a few trails. Have fun. Main goal is to be on a bike and move the legs. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **135 minutes**

Carina dropped me off at Michells Farm and I jogged home from there.  Decent headwind and in sections sheltered from the wind but not the sun, it was quite warm.  I **felt good** but not as fresh as when I did this route back in [January](ironman2021-32weeksout?sun).

With an easier +3 hour bike ride [yesterday](ironman2021-15weeksout?sat), I felt less fatigue in my legs compared to a week ago.

#### RUN: Michell Farm to Tillicum

I was invited for dinner with my in-laws so I jumped on the TT bike for a run up to _Sidney_.  The mountain bike is fun but the TT bike can be fun too.  It is rare for me to ride mostly uninterrupted for 20km on the road so I took this as a chance to learn and make mental notes of the effort and distance.

#### RIDE: Uptown to Sidney

Given the amount of headwind experienced on the run a couple hours earlier, I half expected to get a push for the ride in the opposite direction.  There was a nice tailwind through to _Elk Lake_ but it died off near the intersection of _Island View Road_.  Then it was a slight headwind for the remainder of the ride.  Time to _Sidney_ via the _Pat Bay Highway_ was 45 minutes.
