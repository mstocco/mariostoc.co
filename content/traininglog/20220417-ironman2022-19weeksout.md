# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, April 17, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**19** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Go with the training bump from [last week](ironman2022-20weeksout)

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **13.5 Hours**

I feel like I was **PROGRESSING**

The long run on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) was a bump up that was felt and I found the current limit for my lumbar on the [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) long ride.  Everything [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');) through [Friday](javascript:flick('fri')) was spot on the money.

New running shoes this week too!

## SUNDAY APR 17 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 27 minutes
Might be worth it to do the mobility earlier in the day than the run.

Run 1:50. Easy effort. And I mean EASY.
Get outside, find some dirt. Generally a flat route is preferred. It'll be a lot of time on feet after a lot of cycling.

### NOTES
Total Time: **115 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **18.5 km**

Mobility was done before the run as planned.

Run was mostly on dirt and I headed north on the Colquitz River Trail with the intension of doing a lap of Rithet's Bog before coming back.  I stopped for a bio-break and that was enough of a pause that further up at a fork in the trail, I met up with Yauki!  He was out for a 10km run but when I told him where I was heading, he decided to run with me.

<!---->
That did bump up my effort and cadence for the majority of the run but for the most part, my HR was in the low 130's (not hard).  

At 16km, Yauki headed home and I still had time on my activity so I did a lap of _Cuthbert Homes Park_.

Looking back at what the watch measured, there was a difference in pace and cadence while running with a buddy vs running alone.

Long day at work.

Missed the rollers but did get the mobility work (and some extra stretching) in.  Quads and adductors needed the work.

Rollers ~ 30 minutes. EASY spinning.

### NOTES
Total Time: **96 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **12 km**

Descent sleep last night and I am feeling fresher today.

My right ankle was sore and all three of us complained of heavy legs to start today's run.  That ankle took a long time (7.5 km/47 minutes) to loosen up too; basically to the hill on _Admirals Road_.  From there, I maintained a steady pace, over the top and then found a second wind that carried me up and over _Craigflower Hill_ (for a segment PR on Strava).

Quads were pretty cooked afterwards and I rode the rollers (super easy) to finish the day.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Easy spin to the pool.   
Swim 2800: 
200 easy swim. 
8x 50 w/ buoy D 1-4, 5-8 r :20. Descend easy to relatively strong on #4. 
3x 100 smooth and relaxed free w/ 3x sighting per 50. R :30
6x 300 @ 1/2 IM effort/focus or a touch stronger. Basically...make sure you're keeping your turnover up as the reps go on. R 1:00 after each. 
2x 50 EASY to cool down.

Ride 60 minutes. Easy spinning. Long way home.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 Minutes** &nbsp;Swim: **2800m**

I woke feeling like I didn't sleep very well.

Consequently late getting to the pool; just one of those, _"I'd rather go back to bed"_ kind of mornings.
<!---->
Once in the water, I got to work.  I felt slow overall but did my best to push through and stay on point with the exercise.  Guessing what my HIM pace is in a pool is a challenge and it did keep me focused on the effort.  Lane congestion didn't come into play until the very end of the workout.  In the end, this was a **good swim**.  Robert Johnson complemented me on my improvement before leaving for home.

I skipped on the hour ride after the swim as I was needing to get logged in for work.  I did ride to Frontrunners via _Clover Point_, to pick up a pair of shoes after work for the cumulative hour plus.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
This will look [familiar](ironman2022-20weeksout?thu)...   
90 minutes. On the TT bike. 
And this week, 30 minutes in the bars! I realize you may have already accumulated a good amount of time in the bars. This is more just a reminder to check in and say, _"It's good to be in the aerobars"_, but don't obsess about it too much.

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **40 km**

Another up and down night with dreams weird enough to wake me.

After work, I rode the TT Bike for some base miles up to _Mitchell's Farm_ (standard Emily Carr route), but instead of continuing north on the rough bike path near <a href="https://heritageacresbc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Heritage Acres</a>, I doubled back and included the small hill on _Island View Road_.  I **felt good** but I was passed by 4 old dudes riding a perfect pace-line.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2700: 
300 easy swim to warm up.

### NOTES
Total Time: **109 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **2700m** &nbsp;Run: **4 km**

Another night where a weird dream was enough to wake me.  Second night in a row...

The ride to the pool was wet and I tried to remind myself that in a few minutes, it wouldn't matter because I was about to jump into a pool.  Riding in the wet sucks regardless.

<!---->
I felt like this was another **focused effort** in the pool.  Mentally, 4x 4x100m seemed more daunting than 16x100m.  Maybe it was the weird dream last night that set me up for that.  Once I was in the middle of that set, I tuned into on how the effort felt and set out to reproduce that for every 100m there after.

I spent time after work washing my bikes and prepping the TT Bike for [tomorrow](javascript:flick('sat');).  

---

Then I laced up my new shoes and went for a short run on the _Lochside Trail_ just to _Saanich Road_ (and back).  The sun was out and for and it was finally a bit of pleasant spring weather!

## SATURDAY APR 23‚òÄÔ∏è 
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
4:00 on TT bike.  
Flatter route. A few hills are ok, but just a few. 
A touch easier than you've been riding. 
In the bars is ok/good. But don't force it.  
Fuel: 1000 calories is a good minimum. 
Hydrate early and often. 

Post ride: Stretch as needed. No specific video.

**FUEL AND HYDRATE WELL. You'll need a minimum of a liter of water and 600 calories within 30 minutes of finishing the ride‚Äã**


### NOTES
Total Time: **240 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **102 km**

Minor headache in the morning; frustrating.

New carbohydrate mix, 300ml of maple syrup with 60 ml of coffee for 1080 calories.  I really like this!

<!---->
Still haven't swapped out the 11x25 cassette on the TT Bike; not sure I will until it gets closer to Vic 70.3 because if I stick to local roads that afford me longer times in aero (_Lochside_ up to _Sidney_), the gearing isn't much of an issue on that flattish route.

Today I felt really good at the start of the ride, quite likely from a tailwind pushing me north.  The further up the peninsula I got, the stiffer the wind became.  North of McTavish, the wind direction was easterly, coming off the ocean; even with the crosswind, I was feeling a "push".

First bio-break on _Tatlow Road_ as I followed the Vic 70.3 course.  There will be a detour around the washout on _Chalet Road_ (heavy rains this winter) that I got to recon for the first time.

I skipped the hill on _Downey Road_ as the plan was to ride a flatter route.  Heading south, the wind really started to pick up at the airport and I had a decision to make.  Ride the east side of the peninsula back south (windier) or continue on 70.3 course (hillier). I chose the 70.3 course south on _West Saanich Road_ to _Wallace Drive_.
<!---->
It was also at this point (2.5 hours in) that I noticed my lumbar starting to act up.  I was sitting up more than being bent over.  Second bio-break on _Wallace_ helped a bit.

I was still riding ok (for me) along _Interurban Road_ and I got back needing roughly another hour of riding to do.  I headed west to _Colwood_ then back through _Esquimalt_ when I my front tire popped.  I was able to ride it semi-flat to flat for the next 400m to the _Trek Bike Store_.

They were hoping to sell me a Continental Gatorskin tire for $120 when a can of Vittoria Pitstop was suggested ($23).  I gambled on the can of sealant and what do you know, it worked and I was back on the road in 12 minutes.

That break felt like a world of difference for my lumbar and I was comfortably in and out of the bars along the next 11 km to get me to the 4 hour ride time for the day.

Zero issue with the maple syrup mix and the 70g of Maynards (watermelon) candy.
