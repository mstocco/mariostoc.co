## SUNDAY APR 17 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 27 minutes
Might be worth it to do the mobility earlier in the day than the run.

Run 1:50. Easy effort. And I mean EASY.
Get outside, find some dirt. Generally a flat route is preferred. It'll be a lot of time on feet after a lot of cycling.

### NOTES
Total Time: **115 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **18.5 km**

Mobility first.

Run was mostly on dirt and I headed north on the Colquitz River Trail with the intension of doing a lap of Rithet's Bog before coming back.  I stopped for a bio-break and that was enough of a pause that further up at a fork in the trail, I met up with Yauki!  He was out for a 10km run but when I told him where I was heading, he decided to run with me.  That did bump up my effort and cadence for the majority of the run but for the most part, my HR was in the low 130's (not hard).  

At 16km, Yauki headed home and I still had time on my activity so I did a lap of _Cuthbert Homes Park_.

Looking back at what the watch measured, there was a difference in pace and cadence while running with a buddy vs running alone.

Missed the rollers but did get the mobility work (and some extra stretching) in.  Quads and adductors needed the work.

Long day at work.

Run 60-75 minutes w/ your crew. Easy effort to start. Stronger final 10-15 minutes.   
Rollers ~ 30 minutes. EASY spinning.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Descent sleep last night and I am feeling fresher today.

My right ankle (joint) was sore and all three of us complained of heavy legs to start today's run.  That ankle took a long time to loosen up too; maybe _ km.  By that time we got to the hill on Admirals Road and I maintained a steady pace, over the top and then found a second wind that carried me up and over _Craigflower Hill_.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Easy spin to the pool.   
Swim 2800: 
200 easy swim. 
8x 50 w/ buoy D 1-4, 5-8 r :20. Descend easy to relatively strong on #4. 
3x 100 smooth and relaxed free w/ 3x sighting per 50. R :30
6x 300 @ 1/2 IM effort/focus or a touch stronger. Basically...make sure you're keeping your turnover up as the reps go on. R 1:00 after each. 
2x 50 EASY to cool down.

Ride 60 minutes. Easy spinning. Long way home.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 Minutes** &nbsp;Swim: **2800m**

In bed by 2200 but I woke feeling like I didn't sleep well.  Late getting to the pool; just one of those, _"I'd rather go back to bed"_ king of mornings.

Once in the water, I got to work.  I felt slow overall but did my best to push through and stay on point with the exercise.  Guessing what my HIM pace is in a pool is a challenge and it did keep me focused.  Lane congestion didn't come into play until the very end of the workout.  Overall, this was a good swim.  Robert Johnson complemented my improvement before leaving for home.

I skipped on the hour ride after the swim as I was needing to get logged in for work.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
This will look [familiar](ironman2022-20weeksout?thu)...   
90 minutes. On the TT bike. 
And this week, 30 minutes in the bars! I realize you may have already accumulated a good amount of time in the bars. This is more just a reminder to check in and say, _"It's good to be in the aerobars"_, but don't obsess about it too much.
