### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 27 minutes
Might be worth it to do the mobility earlier in the day than the run.

Run 1:50. Easy effort. And I mean EASY.
Get outside, find some dirt. Generally a flat route is preferred. It'll be a lot of time on feet after a lot of cycling.

### NOTES
Total Time: **115 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **18.5 km**

Mobility first.

Run was mostly on dirt and I headed north on the Colquitz River Trail with the intension of doing a lap of Rithet's Bog before coming back.  I stopped for a bio-break and that was enough of a pause that further up at a fork in the trail, I met up with Yauki!  He was out for a 10km run but when I told him where I was heading, he decided to run with me.  That did bump up my effort and cadence for the majority of the run but for the most part, my HR was in the low 130's (not hard).  

At 16km, Yauki headed home and I still had time on my activity so I did a lap of _Cuthbert Homes Park_.

Looking back at what the watch measured, there was a difference in pace and cadence while running with a buddy vs running alone.

90 minutes. On the TT bike. 
And this week, 30 minutes in the bars! I realize you may have already accumulated a good amount of time in the bars. This is more just a reminder to check in and say, _"It's good to be in the aerobars"_, but don't obsess about it too much.
