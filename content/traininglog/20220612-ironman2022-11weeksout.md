If you are going to run, max out at 5x 2 minutes running, with 3 minutes walking after each. And walking to finish up the 60 minutes.

2nd:  MTB ~ 2:00. Have fun. Use your gears. Get into the trails/hills. 
Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **82 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **26 km** 

The toe was still sore from the ride yesterday and running was off the table.  No formal walk either but I had an another active day doing yard work.  Before I knew it, dinner was around the corner and I hadn't gone for a ride yet.

The ride started out like work but once I got off-road, things became fun.

My normal route up to the north end of Thetis Lake Park is on the asphalt of _Highland Road_. 

<!----->
This evening, I headed up _Phelps Trail_ instead.  It's a little harder work and about 10 minutes longer by taking the fire-road.

The CRD Parks Dept. spread some very coarse aggregate in an effort to "repair" sections of _Belamy Trail_.  Super thankful I ride an XC bike; the cool kids with their gravel bikes are going to be in for a surprise.

I turned off _Belamy_ on to _Electric Light_ for some single track work before looping back for a run on _Comfy Wooden Chair_; **new PR** of 2:42 <small style="font-weight:bold;">-6 secs</small>.
