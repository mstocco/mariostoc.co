2nd:  MTB ~ 2:00. Have fun. Use your gears. Get into the trails/hills. 
Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **82 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **26 km** 

The toe was still sore from the ride yesterday and running was off the table.  No formal walk either but I had an another active day doing yard work.  Before I knew it, dinner was around the corner and I hadn't gone for a ride yet.

The ride started out like work but once I got off-road, things became fun.

My normal route up to the north end of Thetis Lake Park is on the asphalt of _Highland Road_. 

<!----->
This evening, I headed up _Phelps Trail_ instead.  It's a little harder work and about 10 minutes longer by taking the fire-road.

The CRD Parks Dept. spread some very coarse aggregate in an effort to "repair" sections of _Belamy Trail_.  Super thankful I ride an XC bike; the cool kids with their gravel bikes are going to be in for a surprise.

I turned off _Belamy_ on to _Electric Light_ for some single track work before looping back for a run on _Comfy Wooden Chair_; **new PR** of 2:42 <small style="font-weight:bold;">-6 secs</small>.

Bit of an up and down kind of sleep.  My pinkie toe is starting to feel more _"stiff"_ and less sore; a good sign.

Apart from mentally whiffing on 100m with a pull buoy during the warm-up, this was a good swim.  A couple of guys to measure myself against in the lane beside me too; fun!  

Super windy for the ride (road bike) to the pool.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Walk 60 minutes. If you feel great...add in up to 5x 2 minutes easy running.
Spin 60 minutes. Easy riding. Any bike. Generally a flatter route.

### NOTES
<mark>Total Time: **0 Minutes** </mark>

Not sure if it was lack of good sleep catching up with me or not enough calories for dinner or not noticing drinking out of a funky water bottle.  Regardless of the reason, I was hit with a migraine today.  I gave in an took Advil mid-morning and spent a good portion of the day on the couch.

Toe feels better than my head.

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **3000m** &nbsp;Ride: **rollers**

Back as if I was on a mission this afternoon.  First rode to the pool when trouble hit.  I dropped my chain and it weirdly wrapped itself around the bottom bracket shell.  In the process, I bent my front derailleur and small chain ring.  I thought my days of breaking bike parts like that ended in 1997.  Dura-ace is expensive to replace these days.

I got to the pool, spent time washing the bike chain gunk off my hands a went to work.

I really liked this workout because it was challenging to hit 100m at the same effort time after time for ~40 minutes.  No kick board sets and in a 25m pool set this up for a great looking post on Strava too.

I limped home on my broken road bike, took one look at the rain clouds brewing to the west and decided to ride the rollers with. my TT bike.  The effort was "fartlek", getting in and out of the aero-bars over 45 minutes.
