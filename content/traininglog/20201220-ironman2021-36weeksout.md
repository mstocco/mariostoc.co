## SUNDAY DEC 20 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 21 Minutes.  
Bike 2:00: Another day on the MTB. You can do trails around Thetis (anywhere really) or head out to a gravel road or one of the trails. Overall an easy to steady day of pedaling.

### NOTES
Total Moving Time: **110 minutes**

There was a hint of rain and I almost bailed on an outside ride but the shower passed and I headed out on the XC bike toward _Thetis_.  I followed a couple of UVic students out on an easy gravel ride.  It was interesting to see the kit they were wearing; my guess, they take their riding seriously.  They veered right at the fork on _Panhandle Trail_ and I headed up a hill that kicked my ass the last time I rode here.

**Panhandle Hill 2, Mario 0**.  I wonder if a modern XC bike would help me on that climb; grrrr...
<!---->
At _Munn Road_, I decided to head up and find the better entrance to  _Regional South Trail_.  I found it with a right turn at  [_Eagles Lake_](javascript:flkty.select(2);).

Coming out of the park, I took the _Executive West Trail_ and would have ridden it end to end except I there was a deep stream to cross.

This ride was fun and checked off today's box.

### NOTES
Total Time: **53 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **2050m**

I had an okay sleep last night.  I was aware of a heavy rain forecasted for today but I was more than surprised to see some white falling too.  4x4 and an indoor workout scheduled so, no problem.

This swim **flowed well**, but during the last few lengths, I felt a twinge in my hip flexor and after dinner, my right ankle was sore too.  Weird.

### NOTES
Total Time: **102 minutes**

A nice sunny day to get most of the ice from yesterday, melted off the bike paths.

With my Escalantes on, I headed out for 32 minutes of **comfortable base running** in the sunshine.  Zero emphasis on pace; this was just an easy jog with a focus on form and posture.  It was a great afternoon break from work. 
<!---->
Running slow and comfortable also meant that I was not overextending a _tender_ left piriformis.  If I had strides scheduled today, I may have skipped them.  After mobility [yesterday](javascript:flick('mon');), I foam-rolled that piriformis until it finally relaxed but it still needs a bit more time.

After the run, it was back to work to get a project completed for presentation to a customer tomorrow.  Work went longer than expected so I was late getting into the garage for the ride.

With a standing component to the bike workout, I thought I would ride my road bike on the rollers.  Holy man, that was awkward.  It has never been more apparent to me how different the road and TT are.  The road bike was not comfortable at all;  it felt twitchy and it didn't take me long to hang it back on the wall.   

The 70 minute workout was done on the TT bike.  Not only did it feel better on the rollers, it also had the speed and cadence sensors.  I felt a bit sluggish to start but soon found **a good rhythm**; by the time I was on the 4x4:00 reps, I was in an even better space.

### NOTES
Total Time: **77 minutes**

I am guessing a late bike workout didn't help me get the best sleep last night.  I will look to catch up on that tonight.

There was some lane congestion as I was in the Moderate Lane with two older people.  I recorded this in Garmin as two workouts but in reality, it was just one.  What I thought was a good idea to try an old pair of googles, did not work out so well.  Switching them out for my _Kayenne_ googles was the solution.
<!---->
The water felt thicker today or I more likely I was just tired.  I noticed another swimmer packed a water bottle and a gel the last time I swam.  I did the same, bringing a small water bottle with a bit of lemonade for flavour.  I don't think I consumed a consequential amount of calories but this is probably a good habit regardless.

The run was slow and uneventful.  I simply jogged out on _Lochside Trail_ after dark; the path was slippery parallel to _Swan Lake_ but otherwise clear of yesterday's slushy patches.

1930 in the evening, I laid down on the spare bed downstairs and was out like a light.

## THURSDAY DEC 24 üå§
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 20 minutes.  
Run 60 minutes easy, and flat. Whatever day you like. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **62 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **10.3 km**

I fell asleep really early but was up for a number of hours in the middle of the night.  I did eventually fall back asleep but I was pretty groggy this morning.

In contemplating when to run, I weighed two things.  First, I was feeling a bit run down and probably could use a rest day.  Second was tomorrow's wet forecast.  The weather won and I headed out for an easy jog.  There was a hint of heaviest in my legs and a different type of ankle soreness.  It was more so in the joints themselves and not where it is typically, in the tendons.  On a pain scale of 1 to 10, I am calling this a 2, but it is novel and worth writing down.
