Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 21 Minutes.  
Bike 2:00: Another day on the MTB. You can do trails around Thetis (anywhere really) or head out to a gravel road or one of the trails. Overall an easy to steady day of pedaling.

### NOTES
Total Moving Time: **110 minutes**

There was a hint of rain and I almost bailed on an outside ride but the shower passed and I headed out on the XC bike toward _Thetis_.  I followed a couple of UVic students out on an easy gravel ride.  It was interesting to see the kit they were wearing; my guess, they take their riding seriously.  They veered right at the fork on _Panhandle Trail_ and I headed up a hill that kicked my ass the last time I rode here.

**Panhandle Hill 2, Mario 0**.  I wonder if a modern XC bike would help me on that climb; grrrr...
<!---->
At _Munn Road_, I decided to head up and find the better entrance to  _Regional South Trail_.  I found it with a right turn at  [_Eagles Lake_](javascript:flkty.select(2);).

Coming out of the park, I took the _Executive West Trail_ and would have ridden it end to end except I there was a deep stream to cross.

This ride was fun and checked off today's box.

Abundant moisture associated with the low will result in very heavy wet snow over East Vancouver Island.</p><p style="color:red;font-size:0.9em;">For Greater Victoria, there is the potential for local snowfall accumulations of 5 cm near sea level while higher terrain could see amounts up to 15 cm. Rainfall amounts of up to 40 mm are also expected. The heavy precipitation will end by early this evening as the low moves to the east.</p>
