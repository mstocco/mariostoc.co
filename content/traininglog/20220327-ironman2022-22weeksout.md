### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Rode the _North End Loop_ of _Salt Spring_ this afternoon; really nice ride scenery wise and even better with just enough fitness to enjoy the hills of the island.  Easy effort for the most part though my heart rate and blood pressure spiked turning south off _Walker's Hook Road_ on to _Robertson Road_.  There was a straight drop of a hill quickly followed by an equally steep hill on the other side.  A roadsign said the grade was 14%, the speedo briefly read 70kph before rocketing up the opposite hill.

It was getting close to 1700 and _"rush hour"_ on the island; narrow, shoulderless roads and drivers needing to get somewhere had me heading back to the start early.  I was an hour into the ride at this point.

The last bit was a climb up _Broadwell Road_.  Last time I pedalled here, I got a third of the way up and no further.  Today, I pedalled to the top and continued going up to the very top of _Canvasback Place_ (200m of vertical).  I was **stoked**!

Really **rough afternoon**.  I had a headache start around 1000 and I had a couple of regular strength _Advil_ around 1100 and full on shivers there after.  I slept from 1200 to 1430 then woke up hungry.  I ate some sugary cereal and about as fast as this headache came on, it faded away.  I gave my self some extra time before heading out on the run.

Again, the _Channel Ridge Trail System_ delivered.  Sometimes I was on the west side of the hill with the fading light of the evening, sometimes I was in the shadowy east side under a huge canopy of trees.  Just awesome and I felt great too.  Easy(ish) effort up and down.  I am feeling thankful.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **2**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 75-85 minutes easy on the TT bike. Weather looks dry. Dust it off and put it on the road. (assuming it's safe to ride atm) 
Keep the effort easy, and keep the route relatively flat. No need to be in the bars a ton, but you do want to be in the bars for at least 10 minutes to see how it all feels.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

First time outside on the TT Bike since [IM Italy]() and it was like old hat.  Goal was an easy effort with 10 minutes total in the aero bars and that was more than achieved.  Did get rained on briefly, so much for my freshly cleaned bike.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Up and out the door early for a swim.  My legs felt ok commuting to the pool but I know I had a solid effort in the pool because my legs had little juice during the short spin home.

More than the typical congestion this morning when the swim club session squeezed the rest of us into the remaining lanes.  I worked it out and and ended up with a whole lane to myself by 0640.  With the extra rest build into the later sets of 50m, I was able to take the 45s **strong** lengths down to 44, 43 and finished the last one with an honest **50m in 42 seconds**.

Happy with the effort in the pool.
