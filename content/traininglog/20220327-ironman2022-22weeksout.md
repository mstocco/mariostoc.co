# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, March 27, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**22** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Enjoy a time in new place and take a small break in the routine.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **9.5 Hours**

I feel like I was **ENJOYING IT**

Last Saturday was a day off of SBR and this week was mostly spent on _Salt Spring Island_.

I was originally planing on riding back to Victoria on [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');) but decided to stay with Carina through [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');).

I was back on the training plan once home but I did miss 2 swims and a ride this week.

## SUNDAY MAR 27 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Travel to Salt Spring.
Run 45 minutes easy. Nothing hard. 
Just find a stretch of road or trail. Keep it easy. You will probably have to run on some hills. That's ok!

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **8 km**

Easy effort run on the _Channel Ridge Trails_.  This was exploratory through an abandoned subdivision project, on to some marked trails until I got too far/turned around and I had to guess my way back on a series of MTB single track.

My calves were still sore from the hike last Friday.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride home from the Ferry. Easy effort. Have fun.  

### NOTES
Ride Time: **94 Mins** &nbsp; Bike: **30 km** <small>vert: 685m</small>

Change of plans; I am staying on SSI.

Rode the _North End Loop_ of _Salt Spring_ this afternoon; really nice ride scenery wise and even better with just enough fitness to enjoy the hills of the island.

Easy effort for the most part though my heart rate and blood pressure spiked turning south off _Walker's Hook Road_ on to _Robertson Road_.  There was a straight drop of a hill quickly followed by an equally steep hill on the other side.  A roadsign said the grade was 14%, the speedo briefly read 70kph before rocketing up the opposite hill.
<!---->
It was getting close to 1700 and _"rush hour"_ on the island; narrow, shoulderless roads and drivers needing to get somewhere had me heading back to the start early.  I was an hour into the ride at this point.

The last bit was a climb up _Broadwell Road_.  Last time I pedalled here, I got a third of the way up and no further.  Today, I pedalled up to the very top of _Canvasback Place_ (200m of vertical);   
I am **stoked**!

## TUESDAY MAR 29 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 70 minutes easy w/ your group.
Easy as long as you can keep it easy. And a presumed ramp up over the final 5-15 minutes. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **10.1 km**

Really **rough afternoon**.  Headache started at 1000; a couple of regular strength _Advil_ around 1100 and full on shivers there after.  I slept from 1200 to 1430 then woke up hungry.  I ate some sugary cereal and about as fast as this all came on, it faded away.

In the evening, the _Channel Ridge Trail System_ delivered.  Sometimes I was on the west side of the hill with the fading light of the evening, sometimes I was in the shadowy east side under a huge canopy of trees.  Just awesome and I felt great too.  Easy(ish) effort up and down.  I am feeling thankful.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **2**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 75-85 minutes easy on the TT bike. Weather looks dry. Dust it off and put it on the road. (assuming it's safe to ride atm) 
Keep the effort easy, and keep the route relatively flat. No need to be in the bars a ton, but you do want to be in the bars for at least 10 minutes to see how it all feels.

### NOTES
Total Time: **83 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **34 km**

First time outside on the TT Bike since [IM Italy](/racereports/2021-ironman-italy-emilia-romagna) and it was like old hat.

Goal was an easy effort with 10 minutes total in the aero bars and that was more than achieved.  Did get rained on briefly, so much for my freshly cleaned bike.

Run 30 minutes. Easy effort. Flatter route preferred. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2500m**

Up and out the door early for a swim.  My legs felt ok commuting to the pool but I know I had a solid effort in the pool because my legs had little juice during the short spin home.
<!---->
More than the typical congestion this morning when the swim club session squeezed the rest of us into the remaining lanes.  I worked it out and and ended up with a whole lane to myself by 0640.  With the extra rest build into the later sets of 50m, I was able to take the 45s **strong** lengths down to 44, 43 and finished the last one with an honest **50m in 42 seconds**.

![Swim Chart](/assets/jpg/swim-20220401.jpeg)
Happy with the effort and focus in the pool.

Before heading out on the bike, I watched the Oceanside 70.3 race online.  Pretty awesome stuff to see Canadians go 1, 2 in the men's pro race. üá®üá¶

I rode with Carina to up to _Langford_.  From there, I pressed start on my activity and headed out to _Humpback Road_, then linked up with _Kangaroo Road_ via _Highway 14_.  The shoulder is very tight in spots and traffic was heavy on the highway.  The back half of _Kangaroo_ was a **blast to ride** (no cars).

It was _Happy Valley Road_ back to _Langford_, then up _Veterans Memorial Pkwy_ to _Latoria_.  The last climb was leaving the Lagoon, heading up _Ocean Blvd_; I was passed quite impressively by 2 riders that where half my age.  

When I got home, I noticed that I had extra time on the _"officially"_ recorded activity so I rode _Burnside Road_ for some additional time.  

This ride was fun and reflective of my current fitness for terrain and time.
