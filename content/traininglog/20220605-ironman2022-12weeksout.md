### PLANNED WORKOUT
Trainer (yes, that is correct)
90 minutes: 
45 minutes easy riding to start. 
20x :30 high cadence, 1:00 easy spinning. 
15 minutes. Easy riding to finish up.
 
Mobility 55 minutes

Optional: Grass/Barefoot walk ~ 5-30 minutes. If pain in the toe, stop.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 Minutes** &nbsp; Bike Workout: **rollers**

I propped up the rear rollers to get my bike closer to level.  That helped with the pressure felt from the session [yesterday](ironman2022-13weeksout?sat).  If I was paying closer attention, I would have set up the trainer instead.

Half of the first 45 and most of the last 15 minutes were on the aero-bars and I was on the base bar for the cadence reps.

Watched a replay of the start of the Sub7/Sub8 event held earlier today.
