Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Trainer (yes, that is correct)
90 minutes: 
45 minutes easy riding to start. 
20x :30 high cadence, 1:00 easy spinning. 
15 minutes. Easy riding to finish up.
 
Mobility 55 minutes

Optional: Grass/Barefoot walk ~ 5-30 minutes. If pain in the toe, stop.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 Minutes** &nbsp; Bike Workout: **rollers**

I propped up the rear rollers to get my bike closer to level.  That helped with the pressure felt from the session [yesterday](ironman2022-13weeksout?sat).  If I was paying attention, I would have set up the trainer instead.

Half of the first 45 and most of the last 15 minutes were on the aero-bars and I was on the base bar for the cadence reps.

Watched a replay of the start of the Sub7/Sub8 event held earlier today.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Any bike you like. 
1:30-1:45. 
Easy riding. A few rollers are ok, but no major hills. Looking to keep the pressure on the toe...LOW.

Optional: Grass/Barefoot walk ~ 5-45 minutes. If pain in the toe, stop

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **24 km** &nbsp;<small> **&uarr;&darr;**394m </small>

Took half of an allergy pill before bed and that wrecked my sleep; won't do that again.

I took my Rocky Mountain for a run up [Scafe Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);), with a bit of single track for good measure.  I feel like the bit of hill work, plus the extra it takes to pedal the XC bike vs the Road/TT bikes was **good stimulus** for the time invested.

The joint around my pinkie toe feels tired at the end of the day.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Easy spin to/from pool.

Mobility 25 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **~80 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2800m**

Woke up (late) with a tight lumbar and not feeling rested, frustrating.

If I was listening to my body, I would have gone down for a nap this afternoon, but there really is no option to bump today's swim until tomorrow with another 2900m scheduled for Friday.  After work, I jumped on my mountain bike and pedalled to the pool.

<div style="height:27px;"></div>
First 300m proved to have fatigue in my lats but I found a bit of a rhythm after that.  I messed up the 7 x 200m rounds by swimming just 25m easy in between.  I caught my mental gaffe on the seventh rep and after the "cooldown", I ripped off another 150m to make up the shortfall.

Overall, this may not have been the swim that I had on [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');), but I had moments during the 200m sets where I was feeling good.  2pm is still the best time to swim at Crystal Pool as far as lane space is concerned.

Noted before leaving the pool, my pinkie toe and surrounding area are tired and a bit sore after the swim today.
