I did some chores, made linguine from scratch and watched the Seahawks win in OT.  The whole time, I wasn't overly excited about getting on the bike.  Quads did feel worked from [last week](challenge2023-25weeksout).  Maybe it being the last day before returning to work weighing on my mind...

After dinner I did spin my legs; easy effort only.

The rain came down hard all day I didn't really have an appetite for going out in that.  There was a weather window at 1800 and I choose to head out in the dark.  That put me on the sidewalks where there were street lamps made the footing known.

Up and over _Craigflower Hill_ plus the short rolling route to/from and I ending up with ~140m of elevation gain.  My hill reps on _"The Berm"_ net more gain for the same given time.  Something to remember for next time.  Effort was **easy**.
