# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, May 15, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**15** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
To get outside even if we have February weather in the middle of May.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **12 Hours**

I feel like I was **BATTLING**

The first half of the week was a struggle.  Motivation was off, the weather sucked and if I re-read my weekly goal, I wasn't in much of a mood to go outside.  Things improved toward the end of this week (weather warmed slightly). 

Swimming was the bright spot maybe because it is an inside activity.

On [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) however, the ride on the TT bike was probably the most important workout I've done so far this spring.

<!-- I had my first open water swim of the year, thankfully under close to summer like conditions. -->

Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 Minutes** &nbsp; Jog: **18 km**

Sore ankles and tired legs right from the first step.  Fun, just two hours more!  I started late hoping to get a weather window and after about 20 minutes, the rain stopped and I was plodding along with the sun actually poking out.  I did change my mood but not my pace; really slow today.

Had 300 calories (Gu gels), lots of water (running vest) and zero GI.

I went up to _Wilkinson_ and _West Saanich Road_ before doubling back to _Admirals Road_; mostly on the gravel surface of the _Colquitz River/Centennial Trail System_.

I am about 5km or 30 minutes away from making this a lap of _Elk Lake_ (from home).

### PLANNED WORKOUT

Mobility 27 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **55 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2500m**

Another good session in the pool.  Bi-lateral breathing is slowly becoming more repeatably natural.  I once believed that I needed the 50m lane only to progress but I was in the water today when it dawned on me that the more frequent micro-breaks I get at the turns are opportunities to reset posture (feel horizontal) and feel where my feet need to be.

Legs (quads) tired on the bike ride home.

## TUESDAY MAY 17 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 50-60 minutes easy w/ your group. Trying to get them to run a bit shorter than usual. And...avoid the big speed up at the end. Just an easy run in on this one. I imagine your legs will still be a bit tired from the weekend.

Ride 45 minutes EASY. Trainer, rollers, or cruising the flats on the MTB. Whatever the weather provides. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **41 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **6.35 km**

Worked to passed midnight last night (scheduled); slept in until 0730. That became a rough afternoon for the run.

Heart rate was way high to start, legs were heavy and I **stopped to take my pulse** manually to confirm the number on my wrist.  That was enough to calm things down and I plodded on.

<!---->
![Heart Rate](/assets/jpg/hr-20220517.jpeg)

I got to another hill on _Selkirk Avenue_ and same thing repeated.  My legs were labouring and my watch said I was **158 BPM and climbing**.  Again, I walked for a bit before turning for home and calling it a day.

### NOTES
Time: **130 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **2800m** &nbsp;Rollers: **60 Mins**

Up early and **drove to the pool** to make it there for the 0530 opening.

I was able to have a free lane through to the second of three rounds of the main set.  I was pushing through pretty well (comfortably hard) on the 50m lengths too.  Some congestion came into play but overall, this was a super workout.

<div style="height:27px;"></div>
Batuhan was at the pool this morning and before the cooldown, he shared some of his recent experiences at St. George; cool!

Winds of 40 km/h gusting to 70 through this evening had me in the garage on the rollers.  The graphic below says it all about the weather:

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Ride 75 minutes on the TT bike....20-30 minutes easy...
30 minutes, mostly in the bars... with a bit of pressure on the pedals. Not "hard" but around what you might hold for a 1/2 IM. So good focus and riding fairly quickly...but rolling along to do it. 
15-20 minutes easy to cool down/finish up.

2nd: Off the bike: Run 45 minutes EASY

### NOTES
Total Time: **125 Mins** &nbsp;Bike: **~34km** &nbsp;Run: **7 km**

I combined a shopping trip at _Oak Bay Bikes_ with my ride late this afternoon; going (generally) with a decent wind on the way there and into that wind on the way back.  Sunny most of the day and I was rained on along _Dallas Road_ coming back.  It made me pedal the little bit harder to ride away from that rain cloud.

<!---->
<div style="height:27px;"></div>
My right ankle was a bit bothered at the start of the easy run.  Jogged along the _Gorge Waterway_ under sunny skies; that rain cloud gone and happiness returned.

Bean burritos for dinner and no television tonight.

## SATURDAY MAY 21
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **2**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:30 on TT bike:  Warm up ~ 30-45 minutes. Get the legs spinning. 
Then...  
60 minutes, mostly in the bars, with a descent amount of pressure on the pedals. Similar to what you plan to do for the race, or even a touch harder. 
Then it's back to EASY spinning to finish up the ride.

* When going harder: Try to eat/drink while going harder. Try to stay relaxed and efficient. 

Off the bike: Run 60 minutes. Flat terrain. Easy effort, but find your rhythm and breathing

### NOTES
Total Time: **220 Mins** &nbsp;Ride: **72 km** &nbsp;Run: **9.7 km**

The ultimate question of the day was how would my lumbar handle being in the bars for an hour with a bit of urgency at the crank.  The sad answer is it didn't.
<!---->
<div style="height:27px;"></div>
Pretty standard 46 minute spin up to _Mount Newton X-Rd_ with time in the aero bars.  Once there, I hit the lap button on the computer and began to a controlled push for the next 60 minutes.  **Fun two loop circuit** up to the roundabout at _Tulista Park_, then back to the _McTavish Overpass_ through to the last roundabout at the airport, and from there back to _Mount Newton_.  The roundabouts where taken heeled over, not losing much speed; no stopping being the key.  Wind was odd as the small waves on Bazan Bay indicated a NE direction but wind was felt (and sounded) more southerly.

![Bike Speed Graph](/assets/jpg/tt-20220521.jpeg)
I was pretty achy after 20 minutes and I fought it off on the first trip south.  At about _Cy Hampton Park_, the ache subsided and my back felt a better through the south turnaround on _Lochside_.

<!---->
<div style="height:27px;"></div>
Unfortunately, that didn't last and I began fighting that lumbar again, especially on the second trip west to the airport.  I sat up looking for a bit of relief at my last trip over the the _McTavish Overpass_.  I saw that I had less than 8 minutes to gut out the ache and I did just that.

Legs and lungs over 60 minutes?  Excellent.  
Do I have a glaring weakness to work on?  Absolutely.

I spent a good amount (but not all) sitting up and pedalling easy back home.

Lemonade and maple syrup for calories steady throughout the ride (and 60 minute effort).

---

I took the time to stretch before heading out on the hour run.

No issues or niggles and my lumbar does not feel aggravated in anyway by running.  I took things easy on a loop along _The Songhess_, found a nice, comfortable spot plus had a Maurten gel at 25 minutes (no GI).
