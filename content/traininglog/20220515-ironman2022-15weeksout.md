Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 Minutes** &nbsp; Jog: **18 km**

Sore ankles and tired legs right from the first step.  Fun, just two hours more!  I started late hoping to get a weather window and after about 20 minutes, the rain stopped and I was plodding along with the sun actually poking out.  I did change my mood but not my pace; really slow today.

I worked my way up to _Wilkinson_ and _West Saanich Road_ before doubling back to _Admirals Road_; mostly on the gravel surface.

Had 300 calories (Gu gels), lots of water (running vest) and zero GI.

### NOTES
Total Time: **55 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2500m**

No rain but a windy afternoon commute on the bike to the pool.

Another good session in the pool.  Bi-lateral breathing is slowly becoming more repeatably natural.  I once believed that I needed the 50m lane only to progress but I was in the water today when it dawned on me that the more frequent micro-breaks I get at the turns are opportunities to reset posture (feel horizontal) and feel where my feet need to be.

Legs (quads) tired on the spin home.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 50-60 minutes easy w/ your group. Trying to get them to run a bit shorter than usual. And...avoid the big speed up at the end. Just an easy run in on this one. I imagine your legs will still be a bit tired from the weekend.

Ride 45 minutes EASY. Trainer, rollers, or cruising the flats on the MTB. Whatever the weather provides. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **41 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **6.35 km**

Worked to passed midnight last night (scheduled) and slept in until 0730.

Rough day on the run.  Heart rate was way high to start, legs were heavy and **I stopped** to take my pulse manually to confirm the number on my wrist.  That was enough to calm things down and I plodded on.  I got to another rise and same thing repeated.  Watch said I was 158 BPM and climbing so I walked for a bit.  I turned for home and called it a day.

Up early and drove to the pool to make it there for the 0530 opening.  I was able to have a free lane through to the second of three rounds of the main set.  I was pushing through pretty well (comfortably hard) on the 50m lengths too.  Some congestion came into play but overall, this was a super workout.

Batuhan was at the pool this morning and before the cooldown, he shared some of his recent experiences at St. George; cool!

## THURSDAY MAY 19
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Ride 75 minutes on the TT bike....20-30 minutes easy...
30 minutes, mostly in the bars... with a bit of pressure on the pedals. Not "hard" but around what you might hold for a 1/2 IM. So good focus and riding fairly quickly...but rolling along to do it. 
15-20 minutes easy to cool down/finish up.

2nd: Off the bike: Run 45 minutes EASY

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Mins** &nbsp;Bike: **~34km** &nbsp;Run: **7 km**

I combined a shopping trip at _Oak Bay Bikes_ with my ride late this afternoon; going (generally) with a decent wind on the way there and into that wind on the way back.  Sunny most of the day and I was rained on along _Dallas Road_ coming back.  It made me pedal the little bit harder to ride away from that rain cloud.

My right ankle was a bit bothered at the start of the easy run.  Jogged along the _Gorge Waterway_ under sunny skies; that rain cloud gone and happiness returned.
