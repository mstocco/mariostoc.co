# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, August 30, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(4);)

**52 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
This week is going to be all about an emotional reset for me.
There are no planned workouts and if I do any exercise, it
will be for the enjoyment of the activity itself, rather than
any training stimulus it provides.

## SUMMARY
I feel like I was **ON MY WAY BACK &mdash; SLOWLY**

I did miss time this week; part of it was because of work and 
the catching up I had to do, part of it was the the lingering 
sadness from losing my father.  Typically, I would beat myself 
up for the lack of time spent on training; that didn't happen 
this week.  Instead I will take it as a win that I got a couple 
of short runs and a bike ride in.

This week also saw an expected email arrive from the WTC; they 
cancelled/discontinued the local Victoria 70.3 race that I was 
registered for.  So I asked them for a deferral into their 2021 

<!---->
Ironman Canada-Penticton race.  My registration for
Penticton is now officially complete.

Apart from that, I did have a number of phantom aches and pains
this week; these are niggles that I would have expected if I was
mid-way through a heavy training block but I am coming off 3
weeks of no exercise.  Specifically, I have dealt with a very
tender quad (right outer) and an equally tender clavicle part of
my right deltoid.  My neck and traps are still (forever) tender
too.

The heavy heart is still there, and likely will be there for some
time to come but all things considering, this was a good week.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
No planned workout.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

This was a day to reflect on life.  I had no desire to talk to 
anyone, be anywhere or do anything.  I did write the software 
that will power this website today though.  It is not done yet 
but it is getting close!

I would like to think that the weather being cold, gray and 
then rainy had a less than positive effect on my overall mood.

I overslept and had an rough day concentrating on work.  Things 
come and go and sometimes I have good moments of focus and 
other times, work seems overwhelming.  I watched a video detailing 
Challenge Davos and it provided a glimpse of what I might expect 
for a race experience next summer.  I also read that Jen Annett 
posted a 10 hour time on the Penticton course over the weekend 
in an "unofficial" event of about a dozen locals.

Total Time: **40 minutes**

This would have been my father's 79th birthday.  Enough said.

I was awake from 2:30 to 5:30am and had a bit of a headache too. 
I did a walk/jog around Swan Lake and that helped.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
No planned workout.

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

Lumbar and traps are still TAF and I need to continue to work 
on that.  It does feel like a bit of emotional weight has 
lifted; my energy is better today.  I had a better sleep last 
night too.

I did get in a short run in after dinner.  I felt good at a steady but easy pace.  I wore my old Nike Peg Turbos without socks and it felt great for the first 3.5K; I did start to feel a blister coming on and for that reason alone, I stopped running at just over 5K.  I walked home from there.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
No planned workout.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

First time to talk with Elliot since both our worlds recently changed.  I am feeling a bit more motivated to getting moving again.
There are still lingering moments of inability to concentrate; which is ok for now but can't be forever.
I am hoping that I can focus long enough to reduce my current load at work, thus leaving more mental energy to get outside.

### NOTES

This was a bit of a funky day.  I was able to get a number of things done at work which was good to have off my plate and it was a nice day outside; I just didn't pull the trigger on lacing up my sneakers or setting up the yoga mat.  I did receive the email for registering for IRONMAN Canada 2021.  I am in!

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes.
Road ride ~1:30 Easy riding.  Whatever route sounds fun.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I had a much better sleep last night though I did get up once.

I did get on the bike for a spin of the waterfront.  Before I left, the weather was sunny with a breeze.  I mentalty pushed through the idea of how much it is going to suck pedalling on a windy day; the truth was that the wind didn't bother me once I got going.  First time to pedal a bike in a month.  I have no regret for the time off but I was in a really good mood by the time I got home.

The effort was easy with a bit of fun on the odd hill.  I felt a bit of a twinge in both knee caps that eventually passed after 50 minutes or so.
