# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, April 10, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**20** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Repeat [last week](ironman2022-21weeksout) because that felt good.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **13.5 Hours**

I feel like I was **PUSHING THROUGH**

Despite running myself into the ground with a lack of everything (sleep, rest, food) to start the week, I bounced back to slightly better the [previous week](ironman2022-21weeksout) hourly total.  This was my biggest swim and riding (distance) week so far this year.

The TT Bike is on the road but the free hub on my MTB needs service.  The week ended with a spirited brick session on [Friday](javascript:flick('fri');) and a group ride with some punchy moments on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');).

Work had me scheduled for an hour last night starting at 8pm.  Finished at 4am.  FML.

The _Bear Mountain_ subdivision has snow today.  It is almost the middle of April.  WTF?

**Headache all day** likely from how last night shook out.  Advil barely put a dent into it.

I slept midday.

Yesterday's snow on the _Malahat_ stuck around.  Officially it was 4¬∞C (-1¬∞C with the windchill) so I kitted up and rode the mountain bike to the pool this morning.  Where is springtime?

I had an okay session in the pool.

Headache is gone and my lumbar feels good today too.

Fantastic sleep last but I woke up to snow falling (it turned to rain by 0830).

Yauki, Vince and I ran north through the _Marigold_ neighbourhood to the _Quadra Overpass_ befor heading south on _Douglas_.  I had a crack at the _Switch Bridge South_ segment on Strava before finishing the balance of the run to 10km.

Wrapped up with 30 minutes with the TT Bike on the rollers before dinner.

I had a feeling work was going to need me in the morning so I planned on an afternoon swim.  I ended up with a 25m lane all to myself @1445; it has been awhile since I have been a the short pool.

I substituted the paddle-fist for the fist drill b/c I forgot my paddles; regardless, this was a productive time in the water.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes on TT bike. 
Victoria flat route....Waterfront, or Lochside would be nice. Keep the effort easy. Have fun. 
Try to spend at least 20 minutes in the bars (so more than last time, but still not so much that it should be a hassle) 

Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **38.9 km**

Spin up to _Cy Hampton Park_ on the typical _Lochside/Martindale_ route.  Lots of time in and out of the bars (per traffic) and generally, I felt **really good** this late afternoon.

At the ~90 minute mark, I stopped the activity as I was at Mike's house.  After a short visit, I pedalled an additional 17 minutes home.

## FRIDAY APR 15 üå§
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
MTB ~ 90 minutes. Have fun. If you want to ride trails....ride trails. If you feel like an easy cruiser on the Goose...that works too. 
Either way, it's 90 minutes. Generally easy. Having fun.

Run 45 minutes. Easy effort.   
In an ideal world, the run is after the bike, but if a rain shower stops that, don't worry about it.

### NOTES
Total Time: **135 Minutes** &nbsp; Run OTB: **8km** <small>@5:38/km</small>

The mountain bike ride that never made it off the asphalt.  I had another go at trying to eliminate a creak while pedalling my mouthing bike.  I found two stuck lower pivot bearings and thought that might have been the culprit.  Once those units were cleaned, repacked and spinning again, I noticed some play in the rear cassette that needed to be addressed.  Here is where I believe I messed things up.

After putting the freehub and cassette back together, I think I added too much pre-load as I wasn't too far into my ride when I dropped the chain.  
<!---->
Thinking it was a fluke, I carried on but it happened again near the hospital and again on _Highland Road_.  This bike has never dropped a chain in the 6 months I've owned it.  I decided to stop and have a closer look and found the freehub was no longer "free".  I pedalled the bike carefully home and jumped on the rollers for the next 45 minutes.

The run started hot (for me) and stayed pretty much at that rhythm for the balance of the next 45 minutes.

### NOTES
Time: **180 Minutes** &nbsp;Swim: **2800m** &nbsp;Ride: **56 km** 

For all the time in the pool at _Esquimalt Rec Centre_ during COVID, I knew the pool was warm but this morning, it was **bathtub warm**.

Only one lane to share with three people, I moved into the empty "slow" lane and got 80% of my workout done there.

Big pancake breakfast before the ride.
<!---->
Russ Hays group was split into two groups and I started off in back.  Someone mentioned that I'd be better off with the stronger group but they had already gone up the road.

I told the group leader that I'd head up to the first group and then set out to bridge that gap.

After bridging up to the front group, we rode at a pace that was closer to my fitness for the balance of the ride.  They were a bit stronger up the hills, I was able to hold court on the flats; I paced the group the majority of _Happy Valley Road_ on the way back.  The group ride ended at _The Nest Caf√©_ and I rolled in for a coffee with the people I just rode with.

Only 2 out of a 3 hour ride.  Maybe that was a mistake but I could feel the stimulus of the last 3 days in my quads, the weather had turned threatening, I needed a bio-break and home was right there.

Packed 2 bottles with 100g of carb mix (50% Maltodextrin, 40% Lemonade, 10% table sugar, pinch or two of salt).   One bottle consumed and a mouthful of the other. hi
