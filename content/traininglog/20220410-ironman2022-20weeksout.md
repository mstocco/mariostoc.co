Work had me scheduled for an hour last night starting at 8pm.  Finished at 4am.  FML.

The _Bear Mountain_ subdivision has snow today.  It is almost the middle of April.  WTF?

Headache all day likely from how last night shook out.  Advil barely put a dent into it.  I slept midday.

Yesterday's snow on the _Malahat_ stuck around.  Officially it was 4Â°C (-1Â°C with the windchill) so I kitted up and rode the mountain bike to the pool this morning.  Where is springtime?

I had an okay session in the pool.

Headache is gone and my lumbar feels good today too.
