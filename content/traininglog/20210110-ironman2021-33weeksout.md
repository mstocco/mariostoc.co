# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 10, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**33 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
[Last week](ironman2021-34weeksout) was a solid week but I was officially off work.  My goal this week is to have a similar training week while integrating work back into my daily routine.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **STAYING CONSISTENT**.

I finished this week on the longest daily activity streak I think I ever put together &mdash; **17 days**!

I did pick up a tiny issue to the fibularis tertius tendon of my right ankle and though my left piriformis is better, it still gets knotted up.  

Swimming and biking are becoming more comfortable and I am enjoying the running simply for the meditative act of running.

This was an **+11 hour training week**.

## SUNDAY JAN 10 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
MTB ~ 1:45. Hilly route. Easy to moderate effort. Nothing super long, but certainly a solid ride after the couple of days before this.  
Mobility 23 minutes

### NOTES
Moving Time: **120 minutes**

It may have been cloudy to start the day but looking west, dark clouds surrounded Mount Stewart.  2 patches needed to repair the rear tube on the MTB and then I was on the trail.

I took the same route into [Thetis Lake Park](javascript:flkty.select(2);) but instead of following the fire roads north to _Munn Road_, I decided to explore a couple of single track trails that I had be looking at on <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/trails/electric-avenue-101420/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">trailforks.com</a>. 

Overall, this was a **fun ride** with some fatigue in my legs.  The trails were wet but the weather was dry.

## TUESDAY JAN 12 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Trainer ~ 60 minutes. Easy spinning.  
Run 45 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **105 minutes**

With a weather system forecast for this evening, I did the scheduled run first.  I had a tiny, posterior tendon near my right ankle that was angry for the first 20ish minutes of the run; it finally got the message that I wasn't stopping and calmed down.  Apart from that, the run felt **really good**; a bit of drizzle but no bad weather (yet).

### FIBULARIS TERTIUS
![Fibularis Tertius](/assets/jpg/ankle-20210112.jpeg?v2)
<!---->
The ride on the trainer was very easy spinning that started at around 90 RPM and progressively became faster over the course of the hour.  I watched the full replay of the _2020 Arzachena ITU Triathlon World Cup_ (Men's Race).

### CADENCE GRAPH WHILE WATCHING
![Cadendes](/assets/jpg/cadence-20210112.jpeg)

Effort on the bike was **light and easy**; basically one gear and letting my legs spin for an hour.  I was still getting sweaty without the fan going.

All in all, a really good _"Bread and Butter"_ kind of training day (and a good day at work).

One thing I am a bit peeved at is my timing at getting a swim lane booked.  Two days in a row I have been shut out from getting a spot at Esquimalt.

Lastly, I missed an opportunity to do the new warm up routine _before_ the run.

## WEDNESDAY JAN 13 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **5** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 60 minutes. Hilly route. Easy effort.  
Mobility 18 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

Terrible sleep last night; the wind storm woke me up at 0054 and multiple times there after.  The wind was strong enough to damage the railing on our back deck too; I have some woodworking in my near future.  That little tendon in front of my right ankle is angry this morning too.

I procrastinated long enough for the sun to go down and the wind to stop blowing.  I did my _Craigflower Route_ with a few extra hills to make for an hour of hilly jogging.  It was a really nice night for a run too.  I took it really easy because my right ankle is still pretty sore.

## THURSDAY JAN 14 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2000: 4x 100 easy swimming to warm up. Rest as needed. 12x 50 Odds: Building kick, evens: Building swim. R :20. 3x 250 steady swimming w/ consistent turnover. r 1:00. 3x 50 as 25 Strong/25 relaxed. r :20. 100 easy to cool down.

Trainer 60 minutes: 20 minutes easy spinning. 5x 1:00 high cadence/very stable hips, 1:00 easy after each. 2 rounds (:50, :40, :30, :20, :10 high cadence on 1:00. Gradually increasing cadence from :50 - :10) 20 minutes easy to finish up.

### NOTES
Total Time: **110 minutes**

Even though the Esquimalt Pool is just 25m in length, swimming at that facility, with its amount of windows letting in the sunshine is a nice experience.  Apart from a longer rest before the 3x50 set, this was a cleanly executed workout.
<!---->
Last year around this time, I swam at a 25m pool in _South Surrey_ that had a timed 300m effort.  I compared that to today's 250m effort(s).  The data shows similar pace and heart rate between last year and today (measured with the same watch and strap).  But from memory, last year's 300m effort felt a magnitude harder than any of today's 250m efforts.

### NORMALIZED SWIM PACES
![Swim Paces](/assets/jpg/swim-20210114.jpeg)
When coming to the wall at the end of a 250m effort today, it would not have been difficult to add another lap to make it an even 300m.

Late getting on the bike after dinner, but the scheduled 60 minutes on the trainer was completed too.  Not much to report except it is late and time to get some sleep.

## FRIDAY JAN 15 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 40 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort.  
Mobility 17 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Time: **39 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **6.5 km**

Good sleep and even better weather; 15¬∞C, sunny and no wind.

The **streak continues** with a easy run down to the _Bay Street Bridge_ and back.  This was really easy with caution being taken because my right ankle still has tender moments.  I have revisited an old Kelly Starrett ankle treatment (compression and flossing) that seems to be helping.

## SATURDAY JAN 16 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:30 on the road bike. Steady effort. Flat to rolling terrain. OR>>>>> MTB on the Goose or Great trail. Still a steady effort if you ride dirt.  Focus on getting in some steady calories and staying well hydrated. 200+ calories an hour. Try to eat something you'd consider eating on race day.   
Mobility 20 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Time: **170 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **74 km**

I had a good sleep last night and my right ankle is feeling a bit better.

It is nice to have a choice of bikes to ride.  It is easier (for me) to get calories in on a long ride while on the road bike and although it is a cloudy day, the roads are _dry_.  It was the road bike for the win.  It is the middle of January and still no fenders needed; incredible!

<!--With a choice to make, the road bike it would be; it is easier for me to get calories in on a long ride while on the road bike.  The weather was cloudy but dry which is a great bonus for the middle of January. --> 
<!---->
Before heading out, I had 4 pieces of toast and honey and I was packing two bottles with ~200 calories each (Gatorade), 24 jujubes and a pack of _Honey Stinger Chews_ (something new).  Zero GI throughout the ride for a total of ~700 calories consumed on the bike (not counting the toast).  I liked the chews too but they are _expensive_.

I started the ride at a pace like I was going to ride for 3 hours but that didn't last too long; I got into a groove and just went with it.  I wondered at what point I'd regret the early effort but I would pull another snack out of my pocket, wash it down and carry on.  If I did have a low point, it was maybe around the 2:20 point, just past _Brentwood Bay_ on _Wallace Drive_.

There was couple of flare ups with my left piriformis (at the _Ferry Terminal_ and climbing past the entrance to the _Dean Park Subdivision_).

Overall, I am **feeling pretty stoked** about how this ride went and its stimulus felt in my legs afterwards.
