# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 10, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**33 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
[Last week](ironman2021-34weeksout) was a solid week but I was officially off work.  My goal this week is to have a similar training week while integrating work back into my daily routine.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

## SUNDAY JAN 10 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
MTB ~ 1:45. Hilly route. Easy to moderate effort. Nothing super long, but certainly a solid ride after the couple of days before this.  
Mobility 23 minutes

### NOTES
Moving Time: **120 minutes**

It may have been cloudy to start the day but looking west, dark clouds surrounded Mount Stewart.  2 patches needed to repair the rear tube on the MTB and then I was on the trail.

I took the same route into _Thetis Lake Park_ but instead of following the fire roads north to _Munn Road_, I decided to explore a couple of single track trails that I had be looking at on <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/trails/electric-avenue-101420/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">trailforks.com</a>. 

Overall, this was a fun ride with some fatigue in my legs.  The trails were wet but the weather was dry.

## TUESDAY JAN 12 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Trainer ~ 60 minutes. Easy spinning.  
Run 45 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **105 minutes**

With a weather system forecast for this evening, I did the scheduled run first.  I had a tiny, posterior tendon near my right ankle that was angry for the first 20ish minutes of the run; it finally got the message that I wasn't stopping and calmed down.  Apart from that, the run felt **really good**; a bit of drizzle but no bad weather (yet).

### FIBULARIS TERTIUS

The ride on the trainer was very easy spinning that started at around 90 RPM and progressively became faster over the course of the hour.  I watched the full replay of the _2020 Arzachena ITU Triathlon World Cup_ (Men's Race).

### CADENCE GRAPH WHILE WATCHING
![Cadendes](/assets/jpg/cadence-20210112.jpeg)

Effort on the bike was **light and easy**; basically one gear and letting my legs spin for an hour.  I was still getting sweaty without the fan going.

All in all, a really good _"Bread and Butter"_ kind of training day (and a good day at work).

One thing I am a bit peeved at is my timing at getting a swim lane booked.  Two days in a row I have been shut out from getting a spot at Esquimalt.

Lastly, I missed an opportunity to do the new warm up routine _before_ the run.

Terrible sleep last night; the wind storm woke me up at 0054 and multiple times there after.  The wind was strong enough to damage the railing on our back deck too; I have some woodworking in my near future.  That little tendon in front of my right ankle is angry this morning too.
