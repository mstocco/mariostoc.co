## SUNDAY JUN 4 ☀️
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&ast;Fueling, hydrating, and resting as best you can during your race spectating.

1st: Ride 6:00. 
LONG RIDE. 
Distance over elevation gain, but you have the all clear to 
hunt out 1000-1500 meters of elevation gain. Shorter climbs 
are preferred.   
&sat;Eating and drinking often. 

2nd: Off the bike: WALK ~ 30 minutes. Stretch out the legs. 
See how you feel going from the TT bike to being on your feet.

### NOTES
Time: **6.5 Hrs** &nbsp; Ride: **135&#8239;km** &nbsp; Walk: **3&#8239;km**

After cheering on Kelly at her first triathlon at SCP, I put the 
aero-bottle cages on and added a regular cage to the 
top tube.  I also experimented with a concentrated bottle 
of Tailwind.
<!----->
The Tailwind was a failure; way too salty.  On my second pee 
stop, I dumped the remainder and rolled with my lemonade 
recipe mixed thick (250g in 300ml water).  Before I left home, 
I grabbed a bag of _Maynards Watermelon_ candy so I had a ton 
of sugar with me.

The water bottle on the top tube wasn't perfect either.  The 
bottle adds to the stand over height and even with cleats, I 
have no clearance there.  If I continue with this setup, I'll 
need to add a bungee (easy to do) as I did eject a bottle on 
the bumpy _Selkirk Trestle_.

#### RIDE ELEVATION PROFILE
![Ride Elevation](/assets/jpg/accent-20230604.jpeg)
The ride was **solid**.  Lots of climbing on practically 
empty roads [out west](javascript:flkty.select(2);), in aero 
for the _Happy Valley Road_ segment back to _Langford_.  The 
trip up and over _Munn Road_ then the length of _Prospect Lake 
Road_ was a _Strava PR_.  I spent the bulk of my time (safety 
permitting) in the aero-bars through _Central Saanich_ and 
felt (relatively) strong, even after 5 hours.

Quads, glutes (both sides) fatigued; right ankle, near the 
injury site, was a bit sore too.  My lumbar/QL was rock solid 
the whole time.  I never thought to include the _"Total Ascent"_ 
metric on the head unit; I road the hills based on feel and 
accumulated **1875&#8239;m** of climbing.

---

On the scale, before the walk, I was 100g heavier than when I 
left, +6 hours earlier.

The ankle was bothered around 20 minutes into the walk.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
<!--Pre-Run: Dead bugs, breathing, Glute Bridges...:20-:30 second side planks, :30 front planks.
-->
60 minutes on your feet: 
5 minutes walking to warm up. 
10x 4 minutes easy running, 1 minute walk after each. 
5 minutes walking to cool down. 

Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Run/Walk: **8.7&#8239;km**

Descent sleep but my right ankle is on the sore side from the 
ride [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');); my quads and 
glutes are pretty smoked too.

Those heavy, heavy legs took their sweet time out on the run. 
Probably took until the 5th rep before I sort of felt normal; 
the soreness in my ankle started to subside then too.  I made 
it through to the end as written. 

When jogging, pace was 5:43/km for 7.00&#8239;km and it was a 
warm 27&deg;C.

I'd like to say this was _"just a workout"_ but I did have fun with it, first racing the staff to squeeze as many 100&#8239;m reps in before they changed the ropes to the 25&#8239;m format.  Because of how the workout was written, I didn't have to reprogram the watch for the balance of the workout; I was able to manually record the SCM lengths with just the lap button. 

Good workout.
