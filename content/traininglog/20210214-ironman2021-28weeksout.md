# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, February 14, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**28 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Getting up earlier (pre-dawn swims now scheduled), handling the change (my role at work, winter weather) are things that I expect to navigate this week.  I believe I can be a better athlete proprioceptively while in the pool too.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

I feeling bit stiff and sore from shovelling snow yesterday.  I shovelled again today for a couple hours and got +10,000 steps in doing so.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

Poor sleep and I woke with what feels like an MSG headache.  Snow, slush and ice on the roads and the Goose is not clear (yet).  I am going to swap tomorrow's scheduled indoor ride with today's run.

The Advil kicked in early in the afternoon and I was on the rollers before dinner.  Easy effort and I watch the Rich Roll interview of Justin Williams.

2x (100 easy swim, 100 swim w/ buoy, 100 kick. r :20 after each)

Ride 60 minutes: Easy spinning on the trainer or rollers.

### NOTES
Total Time: **52 minutes**

I slept oddly and what was yesterday, general overall muscle soreness from shovelling snow, is now a localized, soreness in my lumbar.  Nothing that was going to keep me from going to the pool but noticeable enough for me to write it down.  
<!---->
The swim itself was ok in the beginning.  I swam in the _"continuous lane"_ this morning and it seemed to be a good rotation with the others I was sharing the lane with.  The watch didn't credit me for the full **2100m** but all the lengths were done; I plugged in the workout and it didn't add up to 2300m (a 600m warmup, a 1400m main set and 100m cool down).  I was just happy to be in the pool regardless.  The last 200m in the main set **felt slower** and I noticed my mind thinking about work on the next 150m effort.  It is unlikely that I will book a 7:30am swim on a work day going forward.

Along with time on the yoga mat, I spent a bit of time on my massage chair this afternoon and it felt good.

I walked instead of running tonight.  My back felt good while moving but if I sit or stand for any length of time, it stiffens up.  I spent about 30 minutes of very focused time on the massage chair tonight and followed that up with another session on the yoga mat.  It felt like the knot gave up its fight while getting worked over by the chair and I had a very satisfying, chiropractic-like realignment while stretching.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 75 minutes: 15 minutes easy spinning to warm up. 8x :45 high cadence, :45 easy spinning after each. 4:00 easy spinning. 2 rounds (3x 4:00 @ a pace you could hold for 30-40 minutes, 1:00 very easy spinning between each) 8 minutes easy spinning after each round. 

Run 30 minutes easy. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

Good sleep last night but more importantly, my lower back can be described as _"deep tissue massage"_ sore and versus the _"protect the spine at all cost"_ sore felt yesterday.

The back held up for most of the day and after work, I decided to get the run done first.  The sun was shining and I'd rather not run in the dark if there was still the odd patch of ice.  I started with a walk (+2 mins), then a light jog.  I felt pretty good; good enough to stray out of my neighbourhood and down the bike path.  I turned around early not because I was feeling bad or that I was worried about my back, but because someone had a pit bull out for a walk and I trusted my instincts to not approach that animal any closer than I did.

The run was a success, or so I thought.  Maybe 30 minutes after getting home, things with my back started to go downhill.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

No swimming.  Up at 0440 to test the back and I am a no-go today.

Specific to what is sore in order of pain:  
- Longissimus Thorasis (Lower Left)
- Tensor Fasciae Latae (Left)
- Sartorius (Left)

I've been here before and even though this sucks right now, I will recover.  Specifically recalling a very similar situation with my back 14 months ago in Maui where I rode the top third of the road to the summit of HaleakalƒÅ after a back spasm just two days before.

Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
3:30 Ride on road or MTB. You haven't hopped on the goose or Great trails. I'm a proponent. Minimal stops, very safe, lots of places to pee. Gives you a great chance to practice drinking more! 
Fueling all day long. That's the name of the game. 
Easy to steady ride. You've got a big run the next day. No need to crush yourself on this ride.
