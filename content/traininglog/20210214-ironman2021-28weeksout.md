# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, February 14, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**28 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Getting up earlier (pre-dawn swims now scheduled), handling the change (my role at work, winter weather) are things that I expect to navigate this week.  I believe I can be a better athlete proprioceptively while in the pool too.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

### PLANNED WORKOUT
3:30 Ride on road or MTB. You haven't hopped on the goose or Great trails. I'm a proponent. Minimal stops, very safe, lots of places to pee. Gives you a great chance to practice drinking more! 
Fueling all day long. That's the name of the game. 
Easy to steady ride. You've got a big run the next day. No need to crush yourself on this ride.
