### NOTES
Total Time: **290 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **132 km**

From _Parksville_ to the first emergency service turnaround after _Bloedel Creek_ with a forecast of winds NW at 7 kph.  The wind was in the opposite direction and I got further up the road on the first half and pressed on the way home.  My QL was good through the first 105 minutes even with a measured effort, the long stretches in the bars was all it took.

600ml of maple syrup and a caffeinated Maurten gel was carried along with +2 litres of water.  Water was empty rolling back into town and I did have a small bit of syrup left.

Spent time in the hotel's <strike>hot</strike> warm tub before dinner.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **59 km**

Back on _Highway 19_ but just out to the intersection at _Horne Lake Road_.  Almost a rinse/repeat for my QL today, it might have turned on me a tiny bit sooner but the effort was higher today.  The wind was a lot lighter today.

90 minutes into the ride, I had a good rhythm going approaching the _Highway 4 Exit_ when I noticed that my rear tire was low on pressure.  I rode for another km before dealing with it.  I pulled a small staple out of the carcass then filled up with Vittoria Pit Stop.  2nd can in row worked and got me rolling again in no time.  

From there, I took _Hwy 4_ toward _Qualicum Beach_.  Looking at the elevation profile afterwards, it was net downhill however, it did seem flatter.  I had a really fast punch past _French Creek_ until I reached a set of traffic lights leading into _Parksville_.

Solid ride. 

Carina and I walked the trails at _Little Qualicum Falls_ (about an hour) and the uphills reminded me of the riding 190kms over [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');) and [today](javascript:flick('mon');).   My toe is sore and still on the swollen side.
