### NOTES
Total Time: **96 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **16.2 km**

Maybe the most important run of the summer is on the schedule.

I feel like I nailed it.  Easy effort to the _Inner Harbour_ then out along _Dallas Road_.  The weather was warm and perfect.  I had moments when I felt good and moments when I felt fantastic.   I packed a 500ml bottle diluted with some of sludge mix left over from the ride [yesterday](ironman2022-3weeksout?sat).

After hitting the 15km mark, I was feeling well enough to round it to an even 10 miles.
