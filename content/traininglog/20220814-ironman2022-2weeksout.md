### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 15km.   Flat route. Easy effort. Remember to fuel as if you're getting into a long day.  Only goal is to cover the distance as comfortably as possible. &mdash; Mobility 25 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **96 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **16.2 km**

Maybe the most important run of the summer.  I feel like I **nailed it**.

Easy effort to the _Inner Harbour_ then out along _Dallas Road_.  The weather was warm and perfect.  I had moments when I felt good and moments when I felt fantastic.   I packed a 500ml water bottle diluted with some of sludge mix left over from the ride [yesterday](ironman2022-3weeksout?sat).

After hitting the 15km mark, I was feeling well enough to round it to an even 10 miles.  More importantly, when I got home I felt like I had run but not cooked.

Something had me awake at 0115 (leftover Indian food perhaps).

After work, I pedalled to _Crystal Pool_ but when I got on the pool deck, the 25m lanes were closed.  Apparently, a part of the filtration system broke and the water was too turbid for lane swimming.  I got back on my bike and briefly thought about riding up to _Thetis Lake_ for an open-water swim but I really wanted to do the scheduled workout as written.  Off to Esquimalt Recreation Centre I rode.

Low and behold, a 25m lane all to myself!  I felt a bit stiff to start but quickly found a groove.

I rode out toward _Colwood_, taking  _The Goose_ home for the balance of riding.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Might need a half day to make this work out.

3x 18 minutes @ IM effort/focus/swimming straight/finding your rhythm. R 2:00 after each. 
Very short cool down splash around to cool down. 

2nd: Run 13km.    
Flat route. Easy effort. You're going to need some water and calories in the system. Pretty solid day on Wednesday, and a solid swim before this run.
