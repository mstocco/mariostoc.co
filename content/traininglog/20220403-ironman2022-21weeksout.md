# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, April 3, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**21** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
After a scheduled reduced week, the goal is to get the train rolling down the tracks.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **13.3 Hours**

I feel like I was **ROLLING**

I finished the week with my lumbar feeling a bit better but a bothersome niggle in my right deltoid has set in.  I got my scheduled workouts done per the plan but mobility was informal sessions throughout the week.

[Saturday](javascript:flick('sat'); ended up being a bigger ride than on paper.

I am looking forward to [next week](ironman2022-20weeksout) to find out how well I absord this week.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 90 minutes. Flatter route. Find some dirt. Goose, Elk Lake, Panama Flats.  
Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **101 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **15.75 km**

Just a long run, on dirt, in Altras, pretty standard stuff and the best way to get on track with another round of consistent training.  

I did explore a bit with a trail on the _Camosun Campus_ but that may have been a wrong idea.  That trail turned upward and somewhat technical to the point that I walked to the top of a hill, took in the view and walked back to a point where I could start jogging again. 

This run, plus the ride yesterday, has my legs feeling pretty worked over.

Terrible sleep.  I think I was woken twice but either a dream or a nightmare and another time for a trip to the bathroom.  Just as I was getting back to sleep, it was time to go to the pool.  Although I did swim last Friday, today's time in the pool felt like karma's payback for missing 2 sessions last week.  Rhythm was a bit disjointed.

I drove to the pool because of a November-like storm this first week of April.

Residual wind from yesterday's storm but it is dry at least.

Better sleep last night and a good run with the neighbours too.  Nice and easy over _Craigflower_ and the hill on _Admirals Road_  then a building to **tempo effort** on the flat, _E&N Trail_ through _Esquimalt_.  By the time we reached the _Goose_, I was leading the crew out at ~8:30/mile.  I was feeling **really good** and just went with it.

I spent 30 minutes on the rollers with the TT Bike after the run; maybe half of the time was on the aero bars.

Good day overall.

Much better time in the pool compared to [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');).  Next to little lane congestion this morning too.  The 16x100m were done in roughly 1:57.  I thought I would clock better times but that was what I had today.

It was **2¬∞C** for the ride to the pool and not much warmer for the ride home.  I pedalled until I couldn't feel the swim in my legs then headed for home for food and warmth <small>(35 minute ride)</small>.

Ride 90 minutes on the TT bike. A few hills would be nice. Have fun. Overall an easier effort, but on a bit of challenging terrain. 
Mobility 25 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Saddle Time: **92 Minutes** &nbsp; Outside: **26 km** 

On the TT Bike (late) after work.  I took a spin up to _Langford_ before turning around.  I headed up _Helmcken/Wilkinson_ before feeling the first of a few drops of rain.  I was needing a bio-break so I headed home and did the balance of the ride (30 minutes) on the rollers.

### NOTES
Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp; Swim: **2500m** &nbsp; Run: **6 km**

Another weird dream night woke me just after 0100.  My right deltoid is pretty lit up; full range of motion but very sore to the touch.

In the pool, I had a good, **focused session**, paying additional attention to rotation.  Today was the first time I noticed a consistent connection between my hips and my arms, particularly during the high turnover 50m lengths.

This wraps up a **7900m week** in the pool.

---

Normally, there really isn't much write about for a half-hour jog but today, my legs started off feeling heavy; expected as I was up early, swam and there was no nap today.  I kept things easy or at least, it was **easy running** in my head.  The final average page, if I had to guess would have been around 6:10/km but I finished with a 5:45/km average.

My heart-rate strap recorded a higher than perceived BPM too.  I am normally not that wrong with effort but apparently this was a harder 35 minute run than I had intended.

Maybe it was the Reactin I took earlier to calm my first strong hayfever reaction of the season.

## SATURDAY APR 9
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 3:30: Road or MTB. That is up to you! But....if you ride the MTB, I ask that you keep it to the Goose. More of a steady push than up and down.  Standard fueling. Standard hydration. Stay warm. Have fun. Never too hard, and conversely always have a bit of pressure on the pedals. Even if it's light pressure.  

### NOTES
Total Time: **210 Minutes** Ride: **68 km** <small>MTB</small>

<span class="agencyvc">Enter the Turbine...</span>  The squal to the north looked threatening but today I was headed southwest; away from the rain and hail but into a ridiculous headwind.  The local weather had the winds pegged at 40kph.  I felt every bit of it too!  Some gusts almost had me stopped on the bike path.

Hoped that the trees lining the _Galloping Goose Trail_ would serve as a wind break.  Maybe in a few short sections but really, not today.
<!---->
Before heading out, I readied my mountain bike with a very thorough clean ; I also swapped the saddle from one that was prevoiusly on my ride bike.  There is still some creaking, either in the suspension or the bottom bracket.  Normally those noises would driven me insane but this afternoon, the wind was so loud, I barely heard the creaking.

I likened today's ride to riding uphill, both ways.  Challenging winds in my face on the way out, but a wind that had all but died for me on the return trip.  At least I was dry.

### Ride on the Goose to Saseenos

The new Rocky Mountain Element, despite having 29" wheels and a clean and lubed chain, requires more effort on a flat path than my old 26" Trek mountain bike.  If things are steep, the new bike has better gearing for going up, and better geometry for going down.  The gear ratios in between however, have me focused and working to maintain momentum.  Bumped up the tire pressure to 33psi front and rear today too.

I am good with the extra effort as makes me stronger but with the recent time on the road and TT bike of late, I really felt this ride's stimulus in my legs.
