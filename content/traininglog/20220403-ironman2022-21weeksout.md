### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 90 minutes. Flatter route. Find some dirt. Goose, Elk Lake, Panama Flats.  
Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **101 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **15.75 km**

Just a long run, on dirt, in Altras, pretty standard stuff and the best way to get on track with another round of consistent training.  

I did explore a bit with a trail on the _Camosun Campus_ but that may have been a wrong idea.  That trail turned upward and somewhat technical to the point that I walked to the top of a hill, took in the view and walked back to a point where I could start jogging again. 

This run, plus the ride yesterday, has my legs feeling pretty worked over.

### NOTES

Terrible sleep.  I think I was woken twice but either a dream or a nightmare and another time for a trip to the bathroom.  Just as I was getting back to sleep, it was time to go to the pool.  Although I did swim last Friday, today's time in the pool felt like karma's payback for missing 2 sessions last week.  Rhythm was a bit disjointed.

I drove to the pool because of a November-like storm this first week of April.

75 minutes. Easy for most of the run, and a build up over the final 5-15 minutes. 

### NOTES
Time: **97 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **12 km** <small>(5:35/km pace)</small>

Residual wind from yesterday's storm but it is dry at least.

Better sleep last night and a good run with the neighbours too.  Nice and easy over _Craigflower_ and the hill on _Admirals Road_  then a building to **tempo effort** on the flat, _E&N Trail_ through _Esquimalt_.  By the time we reached the _Goose_, I was leading the crew out at ~8:30/mile.  I was feeling **really good** and just went with it.

I spent 30 minutes on the rollers with the TT Bike after the run; maybe half of the time was on the aero bars.

Good day overall.

Much better time in the pool compared to [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');).  Next to little lane congestion this morning too.  The 16x100m were done in roughly 1:57.  I thought I would clock better times but that was what I had today.

It was **2°C** for the ride to the pool and not much warmer for the ride home.  I pedalled until I couldn't feel the swim in my legs then headed for home for food and warmth <small>(35 minute ride)</small>.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes on the TT bike. A few hills would be nice. Have fun. Overall an easier effort, but on a bit of challenging terrain. 
Mobility 25 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Saddle Time: **92 Minutes** &nbsp; Outside: **26 km** 

On the TT Bike (late) after work.  I took a spin up to _Langford_ before turning around.  I headed up _Helmcken/Wilkinson_ before feeling the first of a few drops of rain.  I was needing a bio-break so I headed home and did the balance of the ride (30 minutes) on the rollers.

### NOTES
Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp; Swim: **2500m** &nbsp; Run: **6 km**

Another weird dream night woke me just after 0100.  My right deltoid is pretty lit up; full range of motion but very sore to the touch.

In the pool, I had a good, focused session, paying additional attention to rotation.  Today was the first time I noticed a consistent connection between my hips and my arms, particularly during the high turnover 50m lengths.

This wraps up a 7900m week in the pool.

---

Normally, there really isn't much write about for a half-hour jog but today, my legs started off feeling heavy; expected as I was up early, swam and there was no nap today.  I kept things easy or at least, it was easy running in my head.  The final average page, if I had to guess would have been around 6:10/km but I finished with a 5:45/km average.

My heart-rate strap recorded a higher than perceived BPM too.  I am normally not that wrong with effort but apparently this was a harder 35 minute run than I had intended.

Maybe it was the Reactin I took earlier to calm my first strong hayfever reaction of the season.

## SATURDAY APR 9
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 3:30: Road or MTB. That is up to you! But....if you ride the MTB, I ask that you keep it to the Goose. More of a steady push than up and down.  Standard fueling. Standard hydration. Stay warm. Have fun. Never too hard, and conversely always have a bit of pressure on the pedals. Even if it's light pressure.  

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**
