### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Just a long run, on dirt, in Altras, pretty standard stuff and the best way to get on track with another round of consistent training.  

I did explore a bit with a trail on the _Camosun Campus_ but that may have been a wrong idea.  That trail turned upward and somewhat technical to the point that I walked to the top of a hill, took in the view and walked back to a point where I could start jogging again. 

This run plus the ride yesterday has my legs worked.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Terrible sleep.  I think I was woken twice but either a dream or a nightmare and another time for a trip to the bathroom.  Just as I was getting back to sleep, it was time to go to the pool.  Although I did swim last Friday, today's time in the pool felt like karma's payback for missing 2 sessions last week.  Rhythm was a bit disjointed.

I drove to the pool as there was a nasty November storm today, the first week of April.

### NOTES
Total Time: **76 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **12 km** <small>(5:35/km pace)</small>

Better sleep last night and a good run with the neighbours too.  Nice and easy over _Craigflower_ and the hill on _Admirals Road_  then a building to **tempo effort** on the flat, _E&N Trail_ through _Esquimalt_.  By the time we reached the _Goose_, I was leading the crew out at ~8:30/mile.  I was feeling **really good** and just went with it.

### NOTES
Total Time: **110 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2800m**

Much better time in the pool compared to [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');).  Consistency will do that.  Next to little lane congestion this morning too.  The 16x100m were done in roughly 1:57.  I thought I would clock better times but that was  what I had on the day.

It was 2°C for the ride to the pool and not much warmer for the ride home.  I pedalled until I couldn't feel the swim in my legs then headed for home (early) for food and warmth (35 minutes).
