Carina put me on the express train to [Roth](javascript:flkty.select(2);) arriving at noon.  After getting some bearings, finding the Triathlon Park, I set out to _Eckersm√ºhlen_ and the start of my loop.

A local roadie named Flo caught me and instead of riding off my back wheel, we struck up a conversation through to his home just off the race course in _Seiboldsm√ºhle_.
<!----->
I was alone for the ride down to _Greding_, up and over the _Kreissstra√üe RH24_ and didn't see another cyclist going in my direction until _Offenbau_.  A younger guy, tanned with diamonds for calves rolls passed me on a tricked out _Canyon Speedmax_ and offers a me a _"Tsch√ºss"_.  As he headed up the road, I caught a glimpse of his buddy closing in on me too.

Oddly, the gap to the bike in front of me began to shrink and as my shoulder passed _Mr. Speedmax_, I smiled and said, _"Tsch√ºss!"_

Up the road in the little hamlet of _Eys√∂lden_, I made a wrong turn; my detour let the pair of riders catch me again.  It was obvious to me that they knew the route well and I followed as best I could through to the hill before _Hilpoltstein_.

One thing about what these guys were doing was that they seemed to pull away from me when things were flat and I'd be back on their wheel when things turned uphill.  If I was to guess, they were riding with the intention of holding a certain power.

_Solar Hill_ was a lonely climb today and it was predominantly into a headwind from there to _Pierheim_.
<!----->
Energy was starting to go.  It was hot and with no convenience stores (aid stations) on the back half of the loop, water was needed.  On a Sunday afternoon, very little was open.

Before rolling past the swim start, I decided to pull in and check out the scene.  A crew was in the early process of setting things up.  The water in the canal didn't look so fresh.  I'll be giving my wetsuit an extra rinse after the event.

The last leg from T1 to T2 (back to _Roth_) is mostly false flat downhill.

I found a bakery that was open.  For ‚Ç¨7, I bought two small bottles of water and a local brand of cola.

I contemplated riding back to _N√ºrnberg_; as the crow flies, its just 20&#8239;km.  Google Maps estimated and hour twenty by bike though, plus the route looked complicated.

It's 32¬∞C; I opted for the train instead.

From _N√ºrnberg Hbf_ (Central Train Station), the ride through the city was short and when I arrived home, I was into my running shoes pretty quickly.

It was still hot but I did feel **relatively good**, clicking off the 4 minute reps on the pedestrian pathway along _M√ºnchener Stra√üe_ (again).

Terrible sleep last night.  Up at 0200 and didn't fall back to sleep until the birds started chirping.  Probably drained from dehydration and the long day in the heat [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');).

Running this afternoon, I **felt pretty good**; I was expecting to feel a lot worse.
<!----->
I ran to the park and did a lap of _Zeppelinfeld_; it is still a **very ominous experience** to know what was in the 1930's.  I did some stairs on the _Zeppelinhaupttrib√ºne_ just because.

Other things on this run included a run past _Kongresshalle_, a run to the end of _Gro√üen Stra√üe_ finishing up at the front of the _SS-Kaserne_.

Asleep by 2300, up at 0430 and I feel refreshed to start the day.

By the time we arrived at the pool, it was 30¬∫C.  I jumped in without the wetsuit and got to work.

In [May of 2022](ironman2022-15weeksout?fri), I was in a 25m pool and during a 1500&#8239;m rep, I went 18:51 at some point for a 1000&#8239;m PR.

This afternoon in an 50m outdoor pool, I bested that time by 1 second.

I rode a bit longer but the effort was more than EASY (all caps).

Garmin Connect planned a route for me, east of town and I sync'd it with my head unit.  That worked out mostly.  There were a couple of spots where the GPS wasn't as quick and I'd miss a turn (or two).
<!----->
Despite the odd navigational hiccup, I got to ride on some more fantastic German roads, passing by wheats fields and forests.

Thunderstorms rolling in from the southwest and it was a race to get home.

Very light rain when I started the run, but mostly the weather stayed to the west.  Effort was easy and I felt great on the run.
