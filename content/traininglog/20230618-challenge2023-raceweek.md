Carina put me on the express train to [Roth](javascript:flkty.select(2);) arriving at noon.  After getting some bearings, finding the Triathlon Park, I set out to _Eckersmühlen_ and the start of my loop.

A local roadie named Flo caught me and instead of riding off my back wheel, we struck up a conversation through to his home just off the race course in _Seiboldsmühle_.

I was alone for the ride down to _Greding_, up and over the _Kreissstraße RH24_ and didn't see another cyclist going in my direction until _Offenbau_.  A younger guy, tanned with diamonds for calves rolls passed me on a tricked out _Canyon Speedmax_ and offers a me a _"Tschüss"_.  As he headed up the road, I caught a glimpse of his buddy closing in on me too.

Oddly, the gap to the bike in front of me began to shrink and as my shoulder passed _Mr. Speedmax_, I smiled and said, _"Tschüss!" 

Up the road in the little hamlet of _Eysölden_, I made a wrong turn; my detour let the pair of riders catch me again.  It was obvious to me that they knew the route well and I followed as best I could through to the hill before _Hilpoltstein_.

_Solar Hill_ was a lonely climb today and I was predominantly into a headwind into _Pierheim_.

Energy was starting to go.  It was hot and with no aid stations on the course, water was needed.  On a Sunday, very little was open.

Before rolling past the swim start, I decided to pull in and check out the scene.  A crew was in the process of setting things up.  The water didn't look so fresh.  I'll be giving my wetsuit an extra rinse after the event.

The last run to T2 is mostly false flat downhill back to _Roth_.

I found a bakery that was open.  There I bought a couple small bottles of water and a local brand of cola.

I contemplated riding back to _Nürnberg_ but opted for the train instead.

The ride through the city was short and when I arrived home, I was into my running shoes pretty quickly.

It was still hot but I did feel relatively good, clicking of the 4 minute reps on the pedestrian path along _Münchener Straße_.

### NOTES
Total Time: **85 Minutes** &nbsp; Run/Walk: **12.4&#8239;km**

Terrible sleep last night.  Up at 0200 and didn't fall back to sleep until the birds started chirping.  Probably drained from the long day in the heat [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');).

Running this afternoon, I felt pretty good; I was expecting to feel a lot worse.

I ran to the park and did a lap of _Zeppelinfeld_; it is still a very ominous experience to know what was in the 1930's.  I did some stairs on the _Zeppelinhaupttribüne_ just because.

Other things on this run included a run past _Kongresshalle_, a run to the end of _Großen Straße_ finishing up at the front of the _SS-Kaserne_.
