### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12 km**

Not the best sleep and my lumber is tight this morning.  Actually I am feeling a bit smoked from [yesterday](ironman2022-31weeksout?sat).

Heavy rain when I headed out the door.  I had intended to complete 4 laps of _Swan Lake_ to check off the box for _"dirt/trail"_.  Portions of the trail were very sloppy/slick because of wet decomposing leaves.  Today was easy effort and even easier on those slippery sections.

<!---->
Midway through the third lap, I ran into my dear friend [Lincoln](https://www.shlensky.com) and his family who were also out enjoying the trail.  We haven't seen each other in many years and I had zero hesitation to stop my watch and take the moment to catch up.

Once I got going again, I ran to the south end of the trail before hoping on the bike path back home.  This was more like 2 short runs and overall, I was 10 minutes short on the scheduled run time.  I was feeling pretty knackered and probably got enough stimulation for the weekend.

It was tired triceps during the warmup lengths this morning but eventually, I settled into getting some work done.  I had lane congestion to deal with during the 15x50m set and was starting to fade at the end.  Added an extra 50m on the cooldown; seemed like a better idea than walking back from the far end.
