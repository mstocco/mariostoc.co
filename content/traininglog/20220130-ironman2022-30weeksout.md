# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, January 30, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**30** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am doing okay when I record another week like [last week](ironman2022-31weeksout) and the [week before last](ironman2022-32weeksout).  I am winning when I get the mobility and extras done too!

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **~9.5 Hours**

I feel like I was **HANGING ON**

The key workouts of the week happened but...

The miss on [Friday](javascript:flick('fri');) was the a tell and I missed on the goal of getting the extras done (again) this week.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 85 minutes. Easy effort. On dirt/trails for at least half of the run. 
*Bring some calories. And a bit of water too. 

Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12 km**

Not the best sleep and my lumber is tight this morning.  Actually I am feeling a bit smoked from the ride and swim [yesterday](ironman2022-31weeksout?sat).

Heavy rain when I headed out the door.  I had intended to complete 4 laps of _Swan Lake_ to check off the box for _"dirt/trail"_.  Portions of the trail were very sloppy/slick because of wet decomposing leaves.  Today was easy effort and even easier on those slippery sections.

The rain stopped, some blue sky appeared as if something good was about to happen...
<!---->
Midway through the third lap, I ran into my dear friend [Lincoln](https://www.shlensky.com) and his family who were also out enjoying the trail.  We haven't seen each other in many years and I had zero hesitation to stop my watch and take the moment to catch up.  Seeing him, Caren and their children really made my day. 

Once I got going again, I ran to the south end of the trail before hoping on the bike path back home.  This was more like 2 short runs and overall, I was 10 minutes short on the scheduled run time.  I was feeling pretty knackered and probably got enough stimulation for the weekend.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **4** | Soreness **5**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 1850: 
200 easy free. 100 as 25 backstroke/25 free. 
4x 100 w/ buoy. Very gradual descend 1-4, from easy to 1/2 IM effort on #4. R 20 after each.
2x 150 as 25 high turnover/25 relaxed turnover. R :45. 
15x 50 Odds: Strong/high turnover, Evens: Easy. R :20 after each.

_Optional Spin to/from the pool._

Walk 20-30 minutes to stretch the legs.

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Minutes** &nbsp; **Swim: 1900m**

It was tired triceps during the warmup lengths this morning but eventually, I settled into getting some work done.  I had lane congestion to deal with during the 15x50m set and was starting to fade at the end.  Added an extra 50m on the cooldown; seemed like a better idea than walking back from the far end.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 20-30 minutes.

Pm: Run w/ buddies. About 9k. Easy to start....a bit of a pickup to finish over the last few K's.

### NOTES
Total Time: **97 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **11.6 km**

I worked late last night and was back at it early this morning.  Thus the morning rollers became an excuse to spin the legs after the run.  It was on the rollers and a bit wobbly to start too.

Vincent wanted to go a bit further than last week so our route was over _Lampson_ all the way to _Saxe Point_.  I wasn't comfortable until around 6km but then I found a bit of a groove.  It could have been the sugar from the lemonade that I packed with me (50g in 500ml).  Last ~250m was a strong, uphill finish (~40 second kick not really contested this week).

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2200:

4x 50 as 25 backstroke/25 easy free to cool down.

Mobility

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2200m**

Looking at the numbers, the 12 x 100m set, I felt like I was swimming stronger than the 1:55/100 average.  I was able to reproduce those times over 12 reps where maybe in the past, those times might have been sustainable for only half of those reps.

Regardless, I had a good swim this morning with little lane congestion.

## FRIDAY FEB 4
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **6**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 20 minutes easy. 
Run 30 minutes EASY. 

_Nothing too hard. Saturdays are taking some serious time, so we don't want extra Friday stress._ 

### NOTES
<mark> Total Time: **0 Minutes** </mark>

Two plates of spaghetti and a bit of dessert wasn't enough as I woke with a throbbing headache that stuck around all day.

I stayed away from the ibuprofen, listened to my body and made the call to rest for tomorrow.

## SATURDAY FEB 5 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **2**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2000: 
3 rounds (100 easy free, 2x 50 swim w/ buoy. Rest as needed. Warming up) 
9x 50 Gradual descend 1-3, 4-6, 7-9 as 1: Form focused, 2: 1/2 IM focus/effort, 3: Spring distance effort/focus. R :20 after each. 
50 super easy. 
4x 200 aerobic/steady w/ consistent turnover AND buoy. R :40 after each. 
2x 50 easy to cool down.

MTB ~ 2:00-2:15. Have fun. Single track is 100% ok, but probably no more than 50% of the ride should be single track. If you want to repeat last weeks ride, that would be good with me. General effort is easy/controlled. 

As usual, stay warm, stay hydrated, stay well fueled! This goes for the whole day. Not just the bike ride.

### NOTES
Total Time: **160 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2000m**
<!---->
Rested or at least I didn't feel like I was bringing a week of fatigue into the day.

I started the ride in the opposite direction of [last Saturday](ironman2020-31weeksout?sat) but instead of riding up _Goward Road_, I rode up _Viaduct Avenue West_ to get to the fire roads.  This gave me about an hour of steady pressure on the pedals before taking on any single track.

I found a southern connector to a trail called [Lighthouse Extension](javascript:flkty.select(2);) where I got myself turned around.  I lost a bit of pedal time while getting my bearing today but now know of another single option in this area.

In the pool, I felt good from the first length.  There were more people using the facility this afternoon but nothing that effected me getting some work focused work in.  The hardest part was getting the 50m length times to agree with the prescribed effort.  I'm working on that.
