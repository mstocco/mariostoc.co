### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 85 minutes. Easy effort. On dirt/trails for at least half of the run. 
*Bring some calories. And a bit of water too. 

Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12 km**

Not the best sleep and my lumber is tight this morning.  Actually I am feeling a bit smoked from the ride and swim [yesterday](ironman2022-31weeksout?sat).

Heavy rain when I headed out the door.  I had intended to complete 4 laps of _Swan Lake_ to check off the box for _"dirt/trail"_.  Portions of the trail were very sloppy/slick because of wet decomposing leaves.  Today was easy effort and even easier on those slippery sections.

The rain stopped, some blue sky appeared as if something good was about to happen...

Midway through the third lap, I ran into my dear friend [Lincoln](https://www.shlensky.com) and his family who were also out enjoying the trail.  We haven't seen each other in many years and I had zero hesitation to stop my watch and take the moment to catch up.  Seeing him, Caren and their children really made my day. 

Once I got going again, I ran to the south end of the trail before hoping on the bike path back home.  This was more like 2 short runs and overall, I was 10 minutes short on the scheduled run time.  I was feeling pretty knackered and probably got enough stimulation for the weekend.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 1850: 
200 easy free. 100 as 25 backstroke/25 free. 
4x 100 w/ buoy. Very gradual descend 1-4, from easy to 1/2 IM effort on #4. R 20 after each.

Walk 20-30 minutes to stretch the legs.

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Minutes** &nbsp; **Swim: 1900m**

It was tired triceps during the warmup lengths this morning but eventually, I settled into getting some work done.  I had lane congestion to deal with during the 15x50m set and was starting to fade at the end.  Added an extra 50m on the cooldown; seemed like a better idea than walking back from the far end.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 20-30 minutes.

Pm: Run w/ buddies. About 9k. Easy to start....a bit of a pickup to finish over the last few K's.

### NOTES
Total Time: **97 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **11.6 km**

I worked late last night and was back at it early this morning.  Thus the morning rollers became an excuse to spin the legs after the run.  It was on the rollers and a bit wobbly to start too.

Vincent wanted to go a bit further than last week so our route was over _Lampson_ all the way to _Saxe Point_.  I wasn't comfortable until around 6km but then I found a bit of a groove.  It could have been the sugar from the lemonade that I packed with me (50g in 500ml).  Last ~250m was a strong, uphill finish (~40 second kick not really contested this week).
