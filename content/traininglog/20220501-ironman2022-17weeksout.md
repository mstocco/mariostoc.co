### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 3:15 on MTB or road bike. Make sure you have a few hills in the mix. Great trail, riding at the Dump and a mix of hilly roads around town, the goose....they all work. Or you could ride Munns/ect on the road bike. 
Main focus.....Ride 3:15, make sure you get in some time heading uphill.
Fuel early. Fuel often. Goal is to come off the bike well hydrated (needing to pee is a good goal) and well fueled.

Off the bike: Run 45 minutes EASY and FLAT

### NOTES
Time: **225 Minutes** &nbsp;Ride: **70 km** &nbsp;Run: **5 km**

I revisited my MTB to finally figure out what is up with the freehub binding.  After playing bike mechanic for way too long, my best guess is that a $3 axle spacer is worn.

My mood wasn't the best this afternoon.

### ROAD BIKE TODAY

I read _"a few hills in the mix"_ and set off for a hill that I haven't pedalled up since 1997 (a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away).  _Finlayson Arm Road_ from the park, over the top to _Millstream Road_ was the first challenge of the day.  I took my time getting out to the base (about an hour) before visiting my old friend.  The road is in terrible shape though not a big deal while winching myself up at a snail's pace.

Actually, I didn't struggle as much as I thought.  My lumbar (both sides) were angry from the extra torque but they calmed down before the end of the descent.

Once on _Millstream_, I headed up to _Ross Durance Road_, then made my way to the _Lochside_ area via _Brookleigh Road_.  From _Royal Oak Drive_, I headed back out _West Saanich Road_ to _Interurban_ thinking that should get me close to the 3:15 time for this ride.

Either the clock in my head is off or I was feeling better than expected, I got back to "town" quicker than I though I would.  I made up for the extra time by taking a spin out to the hospital before finishing up.

This was a 3 pee ride (5 if you count before leaving and once back in the door).

---

The run was a standard route out to _Quadra Street_ on the bike path.  I was pressed for time and the run was 32 minutes instead of the full 45.  My legs didn't come around until _Swan Lake_ and I knew dinner was on the table getting cold while after the turn around.

Solid late afternoon/evening of exercise and even though I was short on the ride and run, I felt like I got good stimulus into my legs.

Carina was off to the airport at 0500 and instead of going the the pool, I went back to bed.

I swam in the afternoon with a 25m lane all to myself.  In isolation, I had more than 2500m in me today.  Big picture is there is a lot of [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) in my quads left to recover from.

Left lumbar was noticed today; not precarious, just noticed.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run w/ buddies. 70 minutes, easy effort...w/ a short build of 10-15 minutes towards the end. Really try to get them to go the whole 70 minutes. And if you need, bring some calories on the run.

Rollers ~ 30 minutes EASY. Nice and easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **102 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **12 km**

Windy, light showers for the run this afternoon.  It was the regular crew for a typical Tuesday run.  Just how it was written up; easy pace out to _Colwood_ and a slow build from there.  I paced the group along the _Gorge Waterway_ at ~5:25/km with a couple hills between there and the 12km finish at _Tillicum Mall_.

On the TT Bike (set up on the trainer) on the aerobars for 30 minutes before dinner.

### NOTES
Total Time: **142 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **2800m** &nbsp;Ride: **30 km**

Skipped the ride to the pool (raining) with the intension of riding afterwork.

In the pool, I did my best to tune into the 250m distance; long enough to feel a fade, short enough not to settle into too easy of a pace.  There was lane congestion this morning that affected some of my numbers and I worked through the feeling of frustration pretty quickly after being held up too; controlling what I can.

<div style="height:26px;"></div>
Unlike [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');) where I felt like I could swim forever, 2800m was about my limit this morning.
 
I do feel a bit dinged up from [yesterday](javascript:flick:('tue');); left ankle (anterior) mostly.  Maybe the old Escalantes @628 kms are no longer up for that kind of finish to run.  I was also able to isolate a hotspot above (top of) my left lumbar.

After an easy (but cool) spin clockwise around the waterfront, a niggle (soft tissue, anterior, right ankle) flared up.
