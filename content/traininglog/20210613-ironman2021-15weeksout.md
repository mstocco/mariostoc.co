# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, June 13, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**15 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
With the confirmation that Ironman Canada is a go in September, I had to drop my backup plan for Ironman Italy.  It is just more realistic to travel by car to a local race than to fly 9 timezones away during the backend of a global pandemic.  Consistency has been paying off; my goal for this week is to **keep showing up**.  

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **ON THE EDGE**

The carry over from [last Saturday](ironman2021-16weeksout?sat) (the ride in particular) stayed with me throughout this week.

This is the second week that I struggled to find time to journal.  Work has been steady and engaging, the bathroom renovation has taken up some of my time and I still need to

The construction of the _Mckenzie Interchange_ left a 13m high berm to separate the highway from the park.  It's an easy 6 minute easy jog to and from that berm and that was my where tonight's workout was.  16 reps, easy to the top before turning around to head back down.

As I got to the top, a guy, about my age, had walked up the backside of the hill.  I kept doing my thing, jogging up and down while he took in to view from the top.  On his walk down, I smiled at him, he smiled back and I blurted out, "12 more to go...". He thought about it for a moment and came back with, "I am glad I'm not you."

I continued up the hill with a smile and in my head I said, "No bud, I am glad I am not you."  It is Friday evening and I am thankful to be putting in the work to realize a goal.

I got rid of the wasp nest above the garage!  What a relief.

Before heading to the lake, I had a session rolling out my right hamstring; that and my glutes were sore upon waking this morning.

Once in the water, I did find a pretty good rhythm with sighting and breathing.  I swam from Hamsterly to Eagle Beach and I seemed to be quicker on the way back.  There wasn't much of a breeze either.

I rode the TT Bike north from Elk Lake.  I wasn't 6 minutes in when I needed a pit-stop.  The effort was mostly easy.  One thing I did a bit different was to grunt a little longer in the aero bars when on an incline.  Habitually, I am up and out of them when my speed drops below 22 kph.

For calories, I had a can of Redbull (? calories) before I left the lake and got through 1 and a half bottles of lemonade (450 calories).
