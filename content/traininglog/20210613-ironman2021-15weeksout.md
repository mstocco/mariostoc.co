# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, June 13, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**15 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
With the confirmation that Ironman Canada is a go in September, I had to drop my backup plan for Ironman Italy.  It is just more realistic to travel by car to a local race than to fly 9 timezones away during the backend of a global pandemic.  Consistency has been paying off; my goal for this week is to keep showing up.  

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...
