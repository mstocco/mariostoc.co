# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, February 21, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**27 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
This is one is easy.  Heal and not just my back.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **STRUGGLING**

The idea was that if I was to say, not be able to run, then I'd be able to maintain fitness on the bike or in the pool.  That is of course if you don't over do it and put a muscle in your back into spasm.  The past two weeks have felt like two months and I have dealt with a range of emotions, none that I would consider postive.

## 9 DAYS LOST
<sup>and counting...</sup><br />Last week's issue with my **longissimus thorasis** was replaced with an even more acute spasm in my **quadratus lumborum**.   Sitting was next to impossible; sleeping meant waking up with every attempt to roll into a different position.

## SUNDAY FEB 21 

I have been thinking about a new pair of Altra Escalantes as my current pair are on the back half of their training life.  MEC had them in stock so I set off on my walk to downtown.  Walking was ok but if I scooted through a pedestrian crossing because a driver was waiting for me to clear, My lower back was still a bit sketchy.

I got to the store, and tried on a 10.5 and an 11 (just in case there was a sizing difference with the newer model).  I settled on staying with a 10.5 and then...  **POP!**. That one hurt and hurt bad.  There was an instant rush of questions in my head from "how long will I be unable to train after this one?" to "will I be able to walk out of the store?".  It was scary.

## MONDAY FEB 22
No training.   I am stuggling to move about the house.  I am medicating with Robaxact.

---
## TUESDAY FEB 23
No training.  I am still struggling physically and the pain is wearing on me beyond that too.

---
## WEDNESDAY FEB 24
No training but I was able to get into to _The Athlete Centre_ for an assessment on my back.

TLDR:&nbsp; I am on the mend and the injury feels worse than it actually is.  I am ok to walk and swim (neutral spine activities) but need to stay off the bike for a bit longer.

## THURSDAY FEB 25
Not much to report except that my back is feeling marginally better again today and that I typically feel better after an hour on the phone with Elliot.

The soreness is reduced to the QL muscle and a tiny bit of stiffness around the L5/S1 joint.

## FRIDAY FEB 26
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim.  No fixed distance, no fixed pace, no kickboard and no flip turns.

### NOTES
Total Time: **40 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **1500m**

Another morning and another marginal improvement in the range of motion in my back; I am still not 100% and putting on socks is not (yet) comfortable.

Carina and I had a _"Bubble Lane"_ booked at Esquimalt Recreation Centre.  I swam 50s, the odd 100 and the odd 150; sometimes with a pull buoy.  I felt ok, the effort was light and my back felt ok through 1400m (my watch stopped counting lengths at 1150 for some odd reason).

## SATURDAY FEB 27
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
2 short walks.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Maybe the swim was what I needed but I woke up feeling a bit tighter than what I remembered yesterday and on Thursday.
