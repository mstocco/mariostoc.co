## SUNDAY FEB 21 

I have been thinking about a new pair of Altra Escalantes as my current pair are on the back half of their training life.  MEC had them in stock so I set off on my walk to downtown.  Walking was ok but if I scooted through a pedestrian crossing because a driver was waiting for me to clear, My lower back was still a bit sketchy.

I got to the store, and tried on a 10.5 and an 11 (just in case there was a sizing difference with the newer model).  I settled on staying with a 10.5 and then...  **POP!**. That one hurt and hurt bad.  There was an instant rush of questions in my head from "how long will I be unable to train after this one?" to "will I be able to walk out of the store?".  It was scary.

## MONDAY FEB 22
No training.   I am stuggling to move about the house.  I am medicating with Robaxact.

---
## TUESDAY FEB 23
No training.  I am still struggling physically and the pain is wearing on me beyond that too.

---
## WEDNESDAY FEB 24
No training but I was able to get into to _The Athlete Centre_ for an assessment on my back.

TLDR:&nbsp; I am on the mend and the injury feels worse than it actually is.  I am ok to walk and swim (neutral spine activities) but need to stay off the bike for a bit longer.

## THURSDAY FEB 25
Not much to report except that my back is feeling marginally better again today and that I typically feel better after an hour on the phone with Elliot.
