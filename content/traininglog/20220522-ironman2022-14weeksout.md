# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, May 22, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**14** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
IRONMAN 70.3 Victoria race week execution.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **5 Hours**

I feel like I was **PLAYING THE SAFE CARD**

Most of this week I worried about how my back was going to hold up for the race.  After an easy jog on [Thursday](javascript:flick('thu');), I wondered if a new niggle would allow me to complete the run.  Needless to say, I wound down the week resting way more than planned.

One lesson learned this week was that a local race can be more hectic than a race with travel.  Not booking time off work, household and yard work, it all adds up to more to do on top of prepping for a triathlon.

## SUNDAY MAY 22 🌤
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Open Water swim: 
3x 3 minutes to warm up (literally) and to get your bearings. 
Rest is whatever you need. If you're freezing...probably best to just swim easy, find your breath, and relax. 
Once warm....rest about 1 minute between reps. 
3x 10 minutes continuous/smooth/swimming straight. Practicing sighting and finding your rhythm. R 2:00 between each. 
Short 2-3 minute stretch out to cool down.

Mobility 25 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Mins** Open Water Swim: **1970m**

As expected, my left lumbar is tired and sore from the ride [yesterday](ironman2022-15weeksout?sat).

After some chores, Carina and I headed to Elk Lake for the swim (me) and a paddle (her).

The weight I put on since Italy made the wetsuit tight and hard to put on.  The blessing being that there are zero gaps for cold water ingress.

My face, hands a feet were cold to start.  I loosely did the "warm up" and wondered just how uncomfortable this race next Sunday was going to be.  By the end of the first of three 10 minute efforts, I was feeling okay with the cold water.  By the end of the second effort, I was enjoying the cold water.  I finished the swim not really wanting to get out.

I think if I get time in the water before the race starts, I am good to go.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes EASY. 
On road or MTB. TT is fine, but you don't need to ride it.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **24 km**

Terrible sleep last night, very likely from the allergy pill (Reactin) I took at dinner.  I can still feel the ride from [Saturday](ironman2022-15weeksout?sat) in my lumbar too.

After a lazy morning and some chores around the house, I headed out for a spin on the road bike up to Langford.  Efficient, with just one traffic light and easy effort.  Light westerly breeze and really nice weather for a ride.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 45 minutes easy w/ your buddies. Try to get them to go easy the whole run! If not....Just avoid an all out sprint at the end...10 minutes harder won't tire you out by Sunday.

Mobility 22 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **51 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **9.0 km**

Lots of stretching and work with a lacrosse ball on my left glute.  I'm going to get over this ropey lumbar niggle and crush the bike one day.

After work, it was just Yauki and me for the run.  He set a pace just a touch faster than I'll call relaxed; I went with it because it wasn't _"tempo"_.  The important part was really that effort was consistent and no sprint at the end.

In the pool early trying to get as much in before the swim club arrived.  Wore my IRONMAN Italy swim cap; not sure if that was the greatest idea as there were a couple of _"7%-ers"_ in the lane too.  Regardless, I got in a **solid effort**.

<div style="height:27px;"></div>
Spent a bit of time in the hot tub with a jet on my lumbar before riding home.  It is still tight.

Instead of a commute straight home, I rode to _Beacon Hill Park_, through _James Bay_ before hitting the bike path north; hit green lights the entire way too!  I knew that there is real ride this afternoon but this was one last opportunity to _"feel"_ my legs and importantly, Sunday's forecasted temperature after a hard swim.  I was pressing a bit, pacing with a dude on an e-bike.

The race bike is now set up for the weekend.

Went for an easy jog in the rain just up to _Saanich Road_ along the bike path.  Apart from a twinge in my right ankle, I felt really good and could have gone for hours.  Hopefully this is a good sign as my lumbar is still sore.

Mobility 15 minutes

**Solid dinner and hydrate well all day**

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Very **troubling niggle** in my right foot, lateral side, feels like the cuboid/calcaneus joint.  I stayed off it most of the day but after work, headed to _Elk Lake_ to get the lay of the land.

I packed my open-water swim kit and was prepared to swim but that never happened.  I went through the motion of parking at the designated spot at _Beaver Lake_ and taking the shuttle bus over to the venue at _Hamsterly Beach_; timing the procedure.

Athlete check-in had closed but I was able to get information on the modifications to the bike course, check out the transition layout before jumping on the shuttle back to the parking lot.

I did not swim.  The late afternoon wind was up and whitecaps were forming on the lake.  I didn't see an opportunity for anything productive in the water.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Solid breakfast and lunch. Hydrate all day​**  
Spin 30 minutes on the race rig. Making sure all systems are go.

Run 15 minutes EASY.

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 Minutes**

Made a big stack of my chocolate banana pancakes with walnuts for breakfast.  My right foot is still bothersome.

I noodled around on the TT bike, burned off any pre-race anxiousness before [racking my bike](javascript:flkty.select(2);).  I intended to walk/jog back to the parking lot but my sore right foot convinced me to just take the shuttle back; no run this afternoon.

It was back home to organize for an early morning.  BBQ chicken breast and rice for dinner.
