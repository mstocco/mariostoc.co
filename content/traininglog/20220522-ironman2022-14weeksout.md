### PLANNED WORKOUT
Open Water swim: 
3x 3 minutes to warm up (literally) and to get your bearings. 
Rest is whatever you need. If you're freezing...probably best to just swim easy, find your breath, and relax. 
Once warm....rest about 1 minute between reps. 
3x 10 minutes continuous/smooth/swimming straight. Practicing sighting and finding your rhythm. R 2:00 between each. 
Short 2-3 minute stretch out to cool down.

Mobility 25 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Mins** Open Water Swim: **1970m**

As expected, my left lumbar is tired and sore from the ride [yesterday](ironman2022-15weeksout?sat).

After some chores, Carina and I headed to Elk Lake for the swim (me) and a paddle (her).

The weight I put on since Italy made the wetsuit tight and hard to put on.  The blessing being that there are zero gaps for cold water ingress.

My face, hands a feet were cold to start.  I loosely did the "warm up" and wondered just how uncomfortable this race next Sunday was going to be.  By the end of the first of three 10 minute efforts, I was feeling okay with the cold water.  By the end of the second effort, I was enjoying the cold water.  I finished the swim not really wanting to get out.

I think if I get time in the water before the race starts, I am good to go.
