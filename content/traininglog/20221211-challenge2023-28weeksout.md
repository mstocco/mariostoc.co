I feel like I was **RAMPING UP!**

~2500m in the pool feels normal now and I am stoke with how swimming is going.  The bike coming along too.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2600m**

Work had me busy enough to miss swimming the 50m format but I re-programmed the workout for 25m and got the swim done.  Productive time in the water and a dry commute by bike to and from the pool.

### NOTES
Moving Time: **126 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **28.8 km**

Weather window closed faster than the forecast.  If that same weather man is to believed, this may be my last ride outside for sometime.  Who knows?

I pedalled up to the north end of _Thetis_.  I thought by how I was feeling that I'd get to the gate in good time.  Not so as it took me just under 34 minutes this morning.   I might blame the cold weather and softer tire pressure.

I clean run of _Comfy Wooden Chair_ before heading up the fire road toward _Mount Stewart_.  Big white snow flakes started to appear the further up I went.  I took a bit of single track that I hadn't ridden since last spring.  Back then, I needed to push the bike up a steep section, today I cleaned it and didn't stop until I rode down to the edge of [Thetis Lake](javascript:flkty.select(2);).

Pretty cold for the ride on the _Goose_ back to town.
