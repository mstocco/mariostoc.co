# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, March 13, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**24** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Good week to manage some stress, absorb some training.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **11.5 Hours**

I feel like I was **BUILDING**

Lots of good this week despite my lumbar having some stiffness throughout the week.  7500m in the pool, 29km running and a Saturday group ride make up the highlights.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 80 minutes. Easy effort. Similar terrain to last week. (A few hills, and off pavement for much of it)

Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **12.6 km**

A bit restless last night and my lumbar is stiff(er) than usual; time on the TT Bike [yesterday](ironman2022-25weeksout?sat) perhaps?

Started the run with my neighbour Rick and his wife before turning off the Goose for the dirt path north through Panama Flats and a bit more.  That easier, initial pace just seemed to get locked into even after I said goodbye to them.

I felt okay after the run (not taxed) and my back was fine too.

I goofed up a bit plugging the swim workout into Garmin Connect last night and ended up with an extra round of the warm-up (for an extra 300m).  Regardless, I got myself on track for the 50s and plugged away at completing those.  Lane congestion was not as bad as [last Monday](ironman2022-25weeksout?mon)

I spent a bit of time in the hot tub with a jet on my lumbar; the stiffness has moved higher; maybe the first ride on the TT bike?

Bit of a miserable afternoon for a run but the Tuesday Afternoon Crew was ready to go.  I presented the strides option and they were keen to try it out.  We went up and over _Lampson_, then along the _Songhess Walkway_ before finishing with the strides on the _Goose_; last one up to the top of the _Switch Bridge_.

Productive time in the pool though I was ~30 slower than my PR for the 750m.  In my head, I thought I was closer, but today's effort was focused and aerobic with a strong but comfortable last 50m.

During the long spin home, I bumped into Jason Ball and had a nice visit.

Big puddle on and under the bike tonight.  It is time to move the rollers out of the suite and back into the garage.

For some odd reason, the front derailleur would not shift into the big ring so I did the 4 minute efforts with a high(er) cadence.  I still feel like I got good work done.

### NOTES
Total: **105 Minutes** &nbsp;Swim: **2200m** &nbsp;Run: **5km**

I was up at 0303 this morning; felt rested but that was **way too early** for a weekday.  Rode to and from the pool on the road bike and felt the workout from [last night](javascript:flick('thu');).

In the pool it was a lot of focused time.  Lane congestion was a bit of an issue during the 300m reps but was handled.

<!---->
Before the 100m cooldown, I got to chat briefly with Batuhan (he was just starting his workout) about his upcoming trip to St. George.  That break was long enough of a recovery that I finished the last 100m with maybe the best 100m that I've swam to date.  1:43 that felt connected and effortless, at the end of a 2100m workout.  I am pretty stoked.

The run after work had me jog down to Carina's office where she pedalled beside me on the way home.  It's a great way for us to talk after a long work week.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:30-3:00, easy riding. On the road bike. With a nice steady group. 
Coffee/fuel stop around half way.   
Goals: Time in the saddle, fun, stay warm, hydrate, road bike

### NOTES
Total Time: **165 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride(s): **66 km**

Good sleep and a good breakfast.

First group ride in a long time and I didn't really know what to expect.  It seemed to be less formal than I thought.  There were a couple people that were around my fitness level and that should have been enough but Victoria will be Victoria.  

We stopped for a long bit to wait for people at _Emily Carr_ and _Royal Oak_ before heading up _Amblewood Drive_.  Not ever riding up this hill, I kept the effort measured.
<!---->
The next stop was at _Mattocks Farm_ where the entire group came together again.  The next stop was going to be the [Marigold Caf√©](javascript:flkty.select(2);) with the faster riders going as far as _Tulista Park_ before doubling back to the coffee house.  This is where things went differently.

There was a guy that took a flyer up the road ahead of the group, I gave chase and caught him on _Hunt Road_.  I asked him how he was feeling and he said, "great" and I figured he'd sit on my wheel for a bit.  By _Martindale_, I looked back and he was caught by a couple of other riders, maybe 300m back.  I figured if I turn things down a bit, that group of 3 would reel me in and I could have company for the rest of the leg north.

They never made the gap and I rolled up to _Tulista_ and back to the caf√© solo.  Regardless, I was feeling good and 

On the trip back to town, I did get some social time with Jon and Pierre with was great.  By UVic, the wind out of the west was comically unfunny, so I turned for home; I was done.
