A bit restless last night and my lumbar is stiff(er) than usual; time on the TT Bike [yesterday](ironman2022-25weeksout?sat) perhaps?

Started the run with my neighbour Rick and his wife before turning off the Goose for the dirt path north through Panama

I goofed up a bit plugging the swim workout into Garmin Connect last night and ended up with an extra round of the warm-up (for an extra 300m).  Regardless, I got myself on track for the 50s and plugged away at completing those.  Lane congestion was not as bad as [last Monday](ironman2022-25weeksout?mon) and I spent a bit of time in the hot tub with a jet on my lumbar.

The stiffness in my left lumbar has moved higher; maybe the first ride on the TT bike has something to do with that.

### NOTES

I was up at 0303 this morning; felt rested but that was way too early for a weekday (any day).  Rode to and from the pool on the road bike and felt [the workout](javascript:flick('thu');) from last night.

In the pool, I had a lot of focused time to work with.  Lane congestion was a bit of an issue during the 300m reps but handled.  Before the 100m cooldown, I got to chat briefly with Batuhan (he was just starting) about his upcoming trip to St. George.  That break was long enough of a recovery that I finished the last 100m with maybe the best 100m that I've swam to date.  1:43 that felt connected and effortless, at the end of a 2100m workout.  I am pretty stoked.
