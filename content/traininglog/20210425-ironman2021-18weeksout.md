# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, April 25, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**18 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Getting closer to having the dirty work on the renovation done.  One more week of balancing work, training, life and that one project.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **SWIMMING AND BIKING**

Well, the renovation work is coming along slowly and in a way, that is a good thing.  When I do get into the manual labour, it's in smaller, spread out blocks of time.  I am conscious about my back and my overall energy levels and stopping before things begin working against my goals.

Time and frequency on a bike was up this week, starting with the XC bike on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) and finishing with the TT bike on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');).  The only day I wasn't on a bike was [Friday](javascript:flick('fri');).

This was a **+13 hour training week** even with everything else going on.

The weather was wet in the morning so I worked on the reno until the rain stopped later in the afternoon.

### THETIS MTB RIDE
Dark, ominous clouds obscured the hills toward the west.  I resigned to the fact that I was going to get wet and pedalled toward the last bit of lingering weather.  Lucky for me, the weather was clearing fast and by the time I reached the entrance to the _Thetis Park_, the rain had all but ended.
<!---->
The trails were still wet.  I took a run at my favourite bit of single track, _Comfy Wooden Chair_, before heading  up to the summit of _Scafe Hill_.  According to TrailForks, the final trail to the summit is called _"Scafe Hill Push Up"_; no way this is a "push up" as I had to pack the bike on my shoulder for its short scramble sections.

<sup>Looking west toward Mt. Finlayson from the top of Scafe Hill.</sup>

Before leaving the park, I did Comfy Wooden Chair once more.  I was nailing it too until one obstacle; I got a little too confident, lost momentum trying to clear an off camber rocky bit and crashed into a stump.  Most of the wood was rotten and that broke my fall; it could have been worse.

### Tyee & Esquimalt Road OTB
260 calories consumed on the bike helped and my legs felt better than normal.  My only aches were tired feet.

At the 24 minute mark, I started to think about pizza and then got really hungry.  If I would have packed a mask and my bank card, I would have run straight into downtown, found a pizza by the slice restaurant and call it for the day.  Instead, I found myself in a mental battle to block out the cravings and focus on getting home.

It wasn't easy but by minute 37, I was back into a groove and on my way home.

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 minutes** &nbsp; Swim Distance: **2000m**

So Garmin made an update to their Connect app and made it more cumbersome to plug in a swim workout.  I must have done something wrong because the watch seemed to skip over the 100m lengths of the 3 rounds (3x100/50 Strong).
<!---->
Regardless, I carried on and did the 50m STRONG lengths and tacked on the as many of the missing 100m lengths as I could at the end of what was programmed into my watch.

The **water felt heavy** this morning.

Piriformis is back on my left side.

Right thigh is bruised from the falling into that rotten stump yesterday too.
