### THETIS MTB RIDE

Trails wet.  Comfy Wooden Chair, then up to Scafe Hill.  The last trail to the summit is a call Scafe Hill Push Up on TrailForks but I had to pack the bike on my shoulder for the short scramble sections.  The descent down was rated <span style="color:blue;">"blue"</span> and at least a third of it was beyond my comfort level.  

Before leaving the park, I did Comfy Wooden Chair once more.  I was nailing it too but on one rocky bit, I got a little too confident, lost momentum trying to clear an off camber rocky bit and crashed into a stump.  Most of the wood was rotten and that broke my fall; it could have been worse.

Fun ride except for the hike-a-bike bits.

### TYEE ROAD OTB
260 calories consumed on the bike helped and my legs felt better than normal.  My only aches were tired feet.  At the 24 minute mark, I started to think about pizza and then got really hungry.  If I would have packed a mask and my bank card, I would have run into downtown and find a pizza by the slice restaurant and called it for the day.  Instead, I found myself in a mental battle to block out the cravings and focus on getting home.  It wasn't easy but by minute 37, I was back into a groove and on my way home.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

So Garmin made an update to their Connect app and made it more cumbersome to plug in a swim workout.  I must have done something wrong because the watch seemed to skip over the 100m lengths of the 3x

Regardless, I carried on and tacked on the as many of the missing 100m lengths as I could at the end of what was programmed into my watch.

The water felt heavy this morning.

Piriformis is back

Right thigh is bruised from the falling into that rotten stump yesterday too.
