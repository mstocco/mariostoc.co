<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Option 1: MTB ~ 60-75 minutes. Easier route.  
Option 2: Rollers ~ 60 minutes. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Avg HR: **111 BPM**

Despite feeling good on the run [yesterday](ironman2022-46weeksout?sat) and a great sleep last night, I had stiff legs today.

After finally dismantling the last 3 feet of chimney (one more house chore done), I chose to ride the rollers in the garage and listen to the _Seahawks Pre-game Show_ on the radio.

Time started to drag after 36 minutes and my seat interface began to ache after 39 minutes.  At 45 minutes, I took 30 seconds to towel off and relieve the saddle pressure.  I could have called it a win at that point but I jumped back on, found a groove and got to the 60 minute mark.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 1600: 
3 rounds (100 easy free, 100 swim w/ buoy, 100 steady kick. Rest as needed) 
500 continuous/steady. Nothing fancy. Just swim with decent form. 
3x 50 as 15 meters strong/high turnover/35 meters super easy. Rest as needed. 
50 easy to cool down/finish up. 

Optional: 
Short Bike commute. 10 minutes to/from.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **1600m**

Cold, dark and a very thick fog summed up the ride to/from the pool.

Today was my first swim since [IRONMAN Italy](/racereports/2021-ironman-italy-emilia-romagna).  I felt good in the water and 1600m was the perfect distance for the day.

The early morning made the rest of the day drag.

Run 45-50 minutes easy w/ your buddy. Or solo. Just keep the effort easy.   
Stretch 13 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **8.73 km**

[Last Tuesday](ironman2022-46weeksout?tue), I met up with my Yauki for an _"Easy 8K"_.  Today, he introduced me to Vincent, another runner/cyclist from our neighbourhood and the 3 of us headed out for a run.  It was my turn to pick the route so I chose to head out to _Helmcken Road_ via the shoreline and then taking the _Goose_ back.

I **felt good** and the pace slowly picked up each kilometre.  The pace was _faster_ than had I gone alone.

Let's see how I feel [tomorrow](javascript:flick('wed');).
