## SUNDAY JAN 23 ☁️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 70 minutes. Easy effort. Ideally on a bit of dirt/trail. Flat to rolling terrain. Nothing too hilly. 
Mobility 28 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **12 km** (easy)

Upper body is a bit stiff from the MTB ride [yesterday](ironman2022-32weeksout?sat); definitely a more full body activity than riding the rollers.  The more important ding from that ride being the bruise of my left vastus medialis.  Still a bit sore to the touch but there is range of motion.  On the run, I just relaxed, jogged easy and didn't push my luck.

I stopped for about 4 minutes in _Portage Park_ to frame up [this week's photo](javascript:flkty.select(2);).  I made a note to myself at 8.5km mark about how comfortable the jog was going.  Just past the hour mark, I could feel that left vastus start to complain; I was pointed back toward home.

Mobility was a miss.

Cold ride to the pool this morning.  Legs (quads) felt on the tired side, even though I had an ok sleep.  I am noticing the bruised left vast less and less.

Pecks and shoulders felt tired once in the pool too (from the [mountain biking](ironman2022-32weeksout?sat)).  
<!---->
This swim was more of a _"see it through"_ kind of workout in that things never felt relaxed and easy; almost like every length I had a moment where I was checking in with myself to _"stay on point"_.

I even struggled with a leaky goggle on the first few lengths (not normal).

The paddle fist lengths were okay, the shark-fin lengths felt awkward this morning.

Later in the afternoon (after work), I had an honest to goodness nap.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 20-25 minutes easy spinning to start the day. 

Run 50-60 minutes w/ your buddies.

### NOTES
Total Time: **76 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **9 km**

To compliment my nap [yesterday](javascript:flick('mon');), I slept in this morning.  Rollers (easy but steady) before coffee and then off to work.

The Tuesday Run Crew was the same as [last week](ironman2022-32weeksout?tue) but the route today was **hillier**; it was up and over _Craigflower Hill_, then up the hill by the _Four Mile Pub_ and the hills of _Helmcken Road_.

Things played out similar to last week too; I **struggled** to keep pace with my buddies over the bulk of the run; more so on the hills both up and down.

#### Pace and Elevation

As we neared the end, I moved to the front for the last 800m; the pace quickened, I finished with a **strong answer** to Vincent's attempt close the gap I had opened.

Another good sleep though I can still feel a bit of fatigue in my thighs.  My bruised left vast is healing (only slightly sore to the touch, full range of motion).

After a long day at work, I jumped on the rollers and had a focused and productive time on my bike with an extra push nearing the end of the last 4 minute effort.

Not the best night of sleep as I was half awake in anticipation for the early morning swim alarm.

This morning's swim felt like a better workout than [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');); simpler format, more focused.

It was a cold (0°C) and foggy ride to the pool this morning.  I certainly felt the workout on the rollers [last night](javascript:flick('wed');) in my legs this morning.  I arrived just as the staff unlocked the doors at 0530.

On the ride home, the fog receded past the shoreline to reveal a spectacularly clear sky, with Venus, Mars and a bright quarter moon accenting the dawn colours.
