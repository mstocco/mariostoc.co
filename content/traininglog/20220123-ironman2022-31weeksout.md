# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, January 23, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**31** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Put together another week of building base and focus on mobility.

## SUMMARY
Total SBR Time: **10 Hours**

I feel like I was **BUILDING**

On one hand, a bump in duration came this week with an extra swim on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) and I handled that little bit extra well.  On the other hand, I didn't get the goal of doing my mobility and supplemental walking in.  So...  Good week but not a perfect week.

Highlight sessions both came on the bike with the indoor workout on [Wednesday Evening](javascript:flick('wed');) and on/off road route with the new MTB on [Saturday Morning](javascript:flick('sat');)

Mostly dry with below seasonal temperatures.

## SUNDAY JAN 23 ☁️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 70 minutes. Easy effort. Ideally on a bit of dirt/trail. Flat to rolling terrain. Nothing too hilly. 
Mobility 28 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **12 km** (easy)

Upper body is a bit stiff from the MTB ride [yesterday](ironman2022-32weeksout?sat); definitely a more full body activity than riding the rollers.  The more important ding from that ride being the bruise of my left vastus medialis.  Still a bit sore to the touch but there is range of motion.  On the run, I just relaxed, jogged easy and didn't push my luck.

I stopped for about 4 minutes in _Portage Park_ to frame up [this week's photo](javascript:flkty.select(2);).  I made a note to myself at 8.5km mark about how comfortable the jog was going.  Just past the hour mark, I could feel that left vastus start to complain; I was pointed back toward home.

Mobility was a miss.

Cold ride to the pool this morning.  Legs (quads) felt on the tired side, even though I had an ok sleep.  I am noticing the bruised left vast less and less.

Pecks and shoulders felt tired once in the pool too (from the [mountain biking](ironman2022-32weeksout?sat)).  
<!---->
This swim was more of a _"see it through"_ kind of workout in that things never felt relaxed and easy; almost like every length I had a moment where I was checking in with myself to _"stay on point"_.

I even struggled with a leaky goggle on the first few lengths (not normal).

The paddle fist lengths were okay, the shark-fin lengths felt awkward this morning.

Later in the afternoon (after work), I had an honest to goodness nap.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 20-25 minutes easy spinning to start the day. 

Run 50-60 minutes w/ your buddies.

### NOTES
Total Time: **76 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **9 km**

To compliment my nap [yesterday](javascript:flick('mon');), I slept in this morning.  Rollers (easy but steady) before coffee and then off to work.

The Tuesday Run Crew was the same as [last week](ironman2022-32weeksout?tue) but the route today was **hillier**; it was up and over _Craigflower Hill_, then up the hill by the _Four Mile Pub_ and the hills of _Helmcken Road_.

Things played out similar to last week too; I **struggled** to keep pace with my buddies over the bulk of the run; more so on the hills both up and down.

#### Pace and Elevation
![Kilometer Pace](/assets/jpg/run-20220125.jpeg)

As we neared the end, I moved to the front for the last 800m; the pace quickened, I finished with a **strong answer** to Vincent's attempt close the gap I had opened.

Another good sleep though I can still feel a bit of fatigue in my thighs.  My bruised left vast is healing (only slightly sore to the touch, full range of motion).

After a long day at work, I jumped on the rollers and had a focused and productive time on my bike with an extra push nearing the end of the last 4 minute effort.

Not the best night of sleep as I was half awake in anticipation for the early morning swim alarm.

This morning's swim felt like a better workout than [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');); simpler format, more focused.

#### SWIM WORKOUT

It was a cold (0°C) and foggy ride to the pool this morning.  My legs certainly told me about the workout on the rollers [last night](javascript:flick('wed');).  I arrived just as the staff unlocked the doors at 0530.

On the ride home, the fog receded past the shoreline to reveal a spectacularly clear sky, with Venus, Mars and a bright quarter moon accenting the dawn colours.

## FRIDAY JAN 28 ☀️
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **5** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 20-30 minutes easy to start the day.

Run 30 minutes. Nice and easy. Saving some energy for a possible Saturday with a swim and bike. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **36 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **6 km**

Slept better last night but maybe a bit late getting into bed.  It was straight to work this morning too so...
The ~20-30 rollers was a miss. 

The easy jog at the end of the day was not and I was able to do an easy lap of the _Lower Gorge_.

I ran into a neighbour early into the activity and I didn't stop my watch; moving time was 36 minutes vs activity time of 41:30.

### NOTES
Ride Elevation: **~500m** &nbsp; Swim: **1800m**   
Total Time: **160Minutes**

I think Elliot wrote today with the idea of me doing the swim first.  I ended up flipping the order; 50m length swimming at _Crystal Pool_ started in the afternoon at 1530 (no morning lengths).
<!---->
Actually, swimming in the afternoon, even after a 2 hour ride worked out as Carina was able to come to the pool with me and we had a whole lane to ourselves.

For today's ride, I headed on up _Highland Road_, continuing off the pavement to _Munn Road_ before finding my way into the south end of _Mount Work Park_.  That gave me 46 minutes of steady, mostly uphill riding before hitting some single track.  In the park, I discovered a couple of _"new to me"_ trails that where in my comfort zone, and some of _Second Avenue_ (fire road) too.  I exited the park using _Executive West_ but not before exploring _BFF_ to _Kilarney Lake_ first.

During the ride, I finished a 90g bottle of lemonade and the last of my _Maynards_ stash from last season.  Extra water was in my camel back.  I **felt pretty good** on the roads (and trails) leading to home; this was a fun route with a bit of everything.

Later at the pool, I felt the burn in my legs during the kick set but really good otherwise.  I paced the 700m evenly and had enough for a **comfortable** 1:51 final 100m.

I took Carina to _Eva's_ for an early dinner afterwards.  I was hungry.
