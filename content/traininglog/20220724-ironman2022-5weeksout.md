### PLANNED WORKOUT
Open Water swim ~ 
2x 3 minutes easy swimming to warm up. Rest as needed after each. 
3x 15 minutes steady swimming. Ironman effort/groove. Whatever you want to call it. R 2:00 between each. 
Ride 4:00 on the MTB. Great trail, Goose, something like that. 
Bring lots of water and calories. 
This is a big day out. And it will require a lot of fueling!

### NOTES
Total Time: **315 Mins** &nbsp;OWS: **3.2 km** &nbsp;Ride: **62 km**

Up to _Shawnigan Lake_ for some afternoon training.

The lake was awesome; clean, cool water with little wind but some boat wake thrown in to practice with.  I wore my farmer-john wetsuit for the first time and I am not sure if I prefer it over my sleeved wetsuit.  It is certainty a half size smaller and having my arms free was nice.
<!----->
Carina dropped me off at the _Kinsol Trestle Parking Lot_ and I rode the kilometre north to grab [this photo](javascript:flkty.select(2);).  From there it was south on the _Great Trail_ with a couple of **big hills** in between.  I included a trip up and over the _Bear Mountain Parkway_ for good measure.  There was no wind and I was in a long sleeve shirt for any sort of heat adaptation.  My Oakley sunglasses were an obscured salty mess by the end of this ride.
