# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, February 7, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**29 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am starting this week on tired legs and that's ok.  I will get a reprieve [next Sunday](ironman2021-28weeksout?sun) but until then, it is work, workout, eat and rest.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

## SUNDAY FEB 07 ☀️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 1:40. Flat to rolling terrain. Stay well fueled. Keep it easy. Cover some ground!

Mobility: 24 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **103 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **16.6 km**

Even though I slept well last night, my start to the day was pretty stiff and sore; mostly my quads but not exclusively.  I did a stretch routine before jumping in the car with Carina.  She dropped my off at _Mount Newton X-Road_ where I started my jog home.

I may have been making my way south through the countryside, but I was stuck in **heavy leg city** from start to finish today.  Ironically, walking (to time the light the Royal Oak crosswalk) proved to be a sorer experience than just plodding at 6:10/km pace.
<!---->
If the name of the game is to learn how to run on tired legs, then the 10 miles today where money.

200 calories mixed in a 500ml bottle was finished in a litter over an hour.

I do have options to make the back half of this route hillier but I will save that for another day.  I walked the last 600m home.

Up and out the door early for my first swim back at _Crystal Pool_ in almost a year.

Lining up outside the facility before 0730, there was some triathlon swag being sported; an HPR Jacket, Vic 70.3 Hoodie, etc.  The pool had a _Fast, Slow_ and _Continuous Lane_ to self select from.  There were genuine fast swimmers in both the _Fast Lane_ and the _Continuous Lane_.
<!---->
Apart from maybe one or two people, the _Slow Lane_ was people swimming closer to my level.

I felt better than I thought with the change to 50m lengths but the 2x100m kick near the end of the workout bordered on torturous given [yesterday's run](javascript:flick('sun');).

The watch recorded me 50m long but I corrected it manually afterwards.  Here is a pretty chart that says I was in the water:

_15 Minute Full Body Mobility Routine_ was done at the end of the day.  My neck is super crunchy and stiff on the sides.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:15 on the MTB on one of Goose/Great trails or a road/TT bike on flatter roads. Nice steady ride. Fueling shouldn't be too big of an issue, but always good to practice.

OTB: Run 45 minutes. Hilly route. Yes, a bit longer run and the hills will add some intensity.
