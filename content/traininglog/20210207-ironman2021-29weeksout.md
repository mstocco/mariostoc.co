# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, February 7, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**29 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am starting this week on tired legs and that's ok.  I will get a reprieve [next Sunday](ironman2021-28weeksout?sun) but until then, it is work, workout, eat and rest.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

## SUNDAY FEB 07 ☀️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 1:40. Flat to rolling terrain. Stay well fueled. Keep it easy. Cover some ground!

Mobility: 24 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **103 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **16.6 km**

Even though I slept well last night, my start to the day was pretty stiff and sore; mostly my quads but not exclusively.  I did a stretch routine before jumping in the car with Carina.  She dropped my off at _Mount Newton X-Road_ where I started my jog home.

I may have been making my way south through the countryside, but I was stuck in **heavy leg city** from start to finish today.  Ironically, walking (to time the light the Royal Oak crosswalk) proved to be a sorer experience than just plodding at 6:10/km pace.
<!---->
If the name of the game is to learn how to run on tired legs, then the 10 miles of today's run was money.

200 calories mixed in a 500ml bottle was finished in a litter over an hour.

I do have options to make the back half of this route hillier but I will save that for another day.  I walked the last 600m home.

### NOTES
Total Time: **57 minutes**

Up and out the door early for my first swim back at _Crystal Pool_ in almost a year.

Lining up outside the facility before 0730, there was some triathlon swag being sported; an HPR Jacket, Vic 70.3 Hoodie, etc.  The pool had a _Fast, Slow_ and _Continuous Lane_ to self select from.  There were genuine fast swimmers in both the _Fast Lane_ and the _Continuous Lane_.
<!---->
Apart from maybe one or two people, the _Slow Lane_ was people swimming closer to my level.

I felt better than I thought with the change to 50m lengths but the 2x100m kick near the end of the workout bordered on torturous given [yesterday's run](javascript:flick('sun');).

The watch recorded me 50m long but I corrected it manually afterwards.  Here is a pretty chart that says I was in the water:

_15 Minute Full Body Mobility Routine_ was done at the end of the day.  My neck is super crunchy and stiff on the sides.

## TUESDAY FEB 09 ☀️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 70 minutes: 12 minutes easy riding. 2 rounds (:50, :40, :30, :20, :10 high cadence increasing from :50 - :10 on 1:00) 3:00 easy. 8x 2:30 @ a pace you could hold for 30-40 minute, 2:30 easy spinning after each. 5 minutes extra easy riding to cool down.

Run 30 minutes flat and easy. Can be off the bike or earlier/later in the day. Ideally NOT before the bike.

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 minutes**

I had a restful sleep last night and my first steps of the day were less stiff than the past couple of days.

I set up the trainer for the workout on the bike with the idea of doing the cadence and 2:30 reps in the aero bars.  I did have to stop briefly to tighten a spindle nut on the rollers.
<!---->
The workout was done by feel and the looking back on my heart rate data, it didn't look like I was working at all.  My legs felt differently about the exercise; there was a good burn in the quads when it was time to turn a crank.  The low heart rate could have something to do with pedalling in a much cooler garage; who knows?

The run was not right off the bike but it was before dinner.  I felt much better than on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) as I jogged to the trestle and back.  Maybe I was just imagining this but I swear that I could feel the foam in my show get harder the longer I was out in the minus degree weather.

I found a tender spot high up on my left calf with a lacrosse ball tonight.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

Up early this morning and happy to score 3's across the board to start the day.

The swim went ok overall.  I was a bit behind getting to the pool hitting traffic lights on the was to _Crystal Pool_.  I was dreading doing the fist drill in a 50m lane but it was fine.  My biggest issue was the sting from using a bit too much baby shampoo in my swim googles.
<!---->
I missed counted the 300m rep and swam and extra 100m.  I was paying attention to other swimmers and my own effort that I missed the buzzing from my watch telling me that I can stop when I reach the next wall.  I was pretty tight on time this morning too as I was just starting the final 100m when the announcement over the PA system came on to _"get out of the building."_

I was able to get the 40 minute easy run in just before dark.  I jogged the bike path to the trestle and back (same as yesterday), plus a bit more to get to 40 minutes.  I did have an acute but very brief twinge in my right _Fibularis Longus Tendon_ (behind the ankle bone) around the 39 minute mark.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes. Easy spinning.

Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

60 minutes on the trainer but I put a touch more effort in than _"easy"._  

I was a bit concerned (and I know I shouldn't be) with the low heartrate number from the workout on [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');).   I don't have a powermeter and I am still dialling in RPE for indoor riding.

53g of lemonade with a touch more salt in a 600ml bottle downed before the 50 minute mark.

I listened to an episode of _"The 99% Podcast"_ with a video (on mute) of Kona 1997 on the screen.  The same era that Peter Reid would blow by me on local training rides here in Victoria.

I slept in this morning and my feet were oddly sore when they hit the floor.  Odd because I didn't run yesterday.

<h3 style="color:red;border-bottom:1px solid red;">Winter Storm Warning: Greater Victoria</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0;color:red;font-size:0.9em;">Significant amounts of snow are expected.</p><p style="color:red;font-size:0.9em;">Pacific moisture associated with an approaching frontal system will collide with the arctic front along Vancouver Island. Snow at times heavy will begin around midnight and last through Saturday morning.</p><p style="color:red;font-size:0.9em;">Total snowfall amounts of 10 to 25 cm are expected with the higher amounts occurring closer to Juan De Fuca Strait. In addition, strong easterly winds will give areas of poor visibility in snow and blowing snow.</p>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:15 on the MTB on one of Goose/Great trails or a road/TT bike on flatter roads. Nice steady ride. Fueling shouldn't be too big of an issue, but always good to practice.

OTB: Run 45 minutes. Hilly route. Yes, a bit longer run and the hills will add some intensity.
