After pancakes for breakfast and some household chores, I looked at the clock and thought that it would be a waste to wait for the lanes at _Crystal Pool_ to open up when there are lanes advertised at _Commonwealth Pool_.  I jumped on the mountain bike and took a gravel route up to _Royal Oak_.

I indeed had a 25m lane mostly to myself this afternoon.  So awesome!

There was a father that led his 2 young daughters that couldn't swim into the lane.  I only needed to bark at him once before they left for the kids pool.  My real feelings about this being muted.

Apart from that, I might have had my best swim of this spring/winter; certainly it was the longest pool swim I've ever done.  Effort was good, focus was good, I had a young guy in the lane beside me that pushed me just enough.  During the second 12x100m set, I was faster without the buoy as the model I used slipped and took more to hold square between my adductors.

Last cooldown lengths were relaxed and as fast as any length I'd done all day.  I felt like I could have done another 1000.

The activity recorded on the watch did not include the 100m kick set.  I did complete this before the cool down reps.

Back on the bike for the long way home, I headed up to the north end of _Elk Lake_ on the multi-use trail.

A very large rottweiler wanted to attack me on my bike; it took all the strength of its owner to hold it back with a thick leather leash.  Why do people own animals like that?  This was not the entertainment I was looking for when starting on this route.

The energy I had in the pool did not translate into energy in my legs; the ride [yesterday](challenge2023-8weeksout?sat) looked after that.  I just pedalled as comfortably as I could to _Sparton Road_, taking the _Centennial Trail_ back to town.

Solid afternoon but the top of my right foot is noticeably sore tonight.  I hope I didn't over do it today...
