### PLANNED WORKOUT
Walk ~ 30 minutes. Nice easy stroll.

Mobility 33 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 Minutes**

My little toe feels **surprisingly good** today; I cannot explain it.  I am pretty stiff otherwise with the big offenders being glutes, quads and my right hamstring.

In lieu of the walk, I got some yard work done (~an hour on my feet).  Mobility work was completed too.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Spin 45 minutes EASY. Any bike. Inside or outside.   
Mobility 19 minutes  

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **Rollers**

Another good sleep last night though I am still a bit stiff from [the race](/racereports/2022-victoria-half)

Given the bike option, why not both?  I rode my TT Bike on the rollers, but outside in the sunshine with no fan.  This was a hot sweaty 45 minutes at easy effort.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes on TT bike. Easy effort.   
Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 Minutes** &nbsp;Ride: **27 km**

I did not have the opportunity to glue a new tubular on the front wheel so my next best (only) option was my XC Bike.  I kept things easy, and headed out on the _Galloping Goose_, staying on the asphalt to the north end of _Thetis Lake Park_.  I did one run of single track on _Comfy Wooden Chair_ taking another **17 seconds off** my PR for that trail (now at 2:25).  The rest of the ride was fire road to _Langford_, and the _Goose_ home from the RCMP station.

Good route with only a small amount of exposure to cars.

I stopped the ride 300m from home and chatted with my neighbour for about 10 minutes.  Pedalling that last bit home, I could feel fatigue in my legs that was mostly unnoticed during the ride.
