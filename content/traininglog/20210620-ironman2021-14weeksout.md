### NOTES
<mark>Total Time: **0 minutes** &nbsp;</mark>

This was a lost training day.  My right glute/piriformis/hamstring is sore and that little tendon (fibularis brevis) is still angry.

In place of training, Carina and I cleaned the house, top to bottom, getting rid of most of the evidence of a renovation over the past few months.  We then hosted my cousin and his wife on the deck for lunch in the afternoon.  A Father's Day Dinner with Carina's parents filled the evening and but the time we got home, all I wanted was sleep.

Whether it was not exercising or that I was genuinely was feeling off, I was tired and cranky to end the day.

I woke at 0430 with a headache.  I don't think it was dehydration as my weight was a kilo heavier (77.4) this morning.

Hitting the light at _Douglas_ and _Finlayson_ gave me a PR for the commute to _Crystal Pool_.

Once in the water, I felt good, minus the throbbing headache.  The  times recorded for some sets in the workout file might be a little less consistent because of some lane congestion but the effort was there.  I missed the final 100m cool down because I was getting short on.  The bulk of the work got done and I think I was "feeling the water" ok this morning.

The round about way to commute home took me along Dallas Road in a counterclockwise route along the waterfront.  I ran into a my friend Costain and his new puppy "Eddy".  It was the first time since the pandemic since we've seen each other (in person).  The weather was perfect for a morning ride and although my quads didn't feel completely fresh, I did get a spin in.
