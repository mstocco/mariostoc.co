### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **3200m** 

All LCM today but recorded as 2 activities in Garmin because I hit a button on the watch by mistake.  The pool was a bit of a gong-shop today with a reduced amount of lanes (down to one double lane for the last 30 minutes).  

Regardless, I swam at my own pace and spent a good amount of time working on the catch/pull with my non-dominant hand.

I was stiff from the ride [yesterday](challenge2023-10weeksout?sat) but I left the pool feeling great this afternoon.

40 minutes with the new TT Bike on the rollers after dinner.

### Questions for the Doctor
 
1. In the healing process, What stage is the bone at? 
2. Are you cleared to have the boot off at all times? If so, what shows you're ready for that? If not, what shows you need more time? 
3. Are you allowed to do "purposeful walking"? Aka-Walk 30-90 minutes, for exercise. 
4. Are you allowed to do purposeful running, or run/walking"? Remind them you run regularly, and exercise regularly. If you are NOT allowed, why, and how soon do they think you will be allowed? 
5. Are there any activities to avoid at this point? 
6. Do they recommend you going to a physio? If yes, why? If no, why?
