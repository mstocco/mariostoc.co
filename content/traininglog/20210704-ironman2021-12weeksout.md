Bike Comute Time: **90 minutes**

Nice day so instead of driving to Elk Lake, I thought I would ride.  I don't know what I was thinking as it is ~45 minutes of pedalling to get to Hamsterly Beach; meaning an hour and a half of pedalling that was not on the calendar for today.  I pedalled softly.
<!---->
Once in the water and away from the flotila of blown up objects, I felt pretty comfortable.  Garmin doesn't have a way to do two different interval lengths for their OWS activities so I after the 4x2 minute warm up, I had to stop the activity, reset the interval value and start a second activity.  In doing that, I pressed start and for whatever reason, must have pressed stop because I swam probably 10 minutes without the watch recording.  Regardless, I got myself back on track with the 4x8 minute set and continued swimming straight and with a nice rythmn.

The first lap of the lake was easy running.

The second lap started to become a slog.

Store brand drink mix (strawberry) for the first lap/first bottle.  Maurten 320 for the second lap/second bottle.

12 minute bike to Esquimalt Rec Centre (14 minutes back).

Shared the fast lane with a guy more that half my age that was a swimmer most of his life.  Really awesome experience and it pushed me harder than I likely would have otherwise.  My arms, shoulders and lats were tired but I worked through it and got out of the water feeling like I accomplished something.

## TUESDAY JUL 6 ☀️
Sleep **5** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:30 on TT bike. Easy spin out to Willis Point road. 3x 8 minutes uphill @ an effort you can hold for 40-50 minutes all out. Easy descent after each effort. Easy spin home to finish up. 
Make sure you have some calories in your water bottle.

Off the bike or earlier in the day.... Run 25 minutes flat and EASY.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

0100 wake up to hit the bathroom and take an Advil; my head is throbbing.  I don't know if I can point to de-hydration because my weight is _"normal"_ but I am bunged up.

0630 and the headache is still there but movement begets movement and I have    finally evacuated myself (twice).  The coffee helped.
<!---->
Also, my lumbar is lit up (again) and that is **super frustrating**.

Rode the route as written with 3 times up Willis Point Road to the turn around near the dump.  I got about 50m further up the road on the second time up and maybe 150m further on third effort.  Just as important was spendig the time going fast downhill on the TT bike.

No issues with the bike while on the bike but getting upright and walking the bike to the garage afterward was a tender experience.

## WEDNESDAY JUL 7 ☀️
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 60 minutes, hilly route. EASY effort. 
Followed by 12x :20 flat strides, :40 walk after each. Short walk to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Movement in the night was enough to have my back wake me up.  I am sore again this morning (expected).

I laced up my shoes after dinner and started with a walk.  I tried running for a short bit but there wasn't much life in the legs tonight.  I continue to the manmade hill in Cuthbert Homes Park and walked up it 10 times before walking home.  

Live to fight another day.

## THURSDAY JUL 8 ☀️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT

3 rounds (100 easy free, 100 moderate effort w/ buoy r :20 after each) 
8x 200 as 25 meters strong/25 meters relaxed-smooth. r :45. Odds: Swim, Evens: w/ buoy.

100 easy to cool down.

Ride 60 minutes EASY on the way home from the pool.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2500m**

This swim hit the mark in terms of distance but when looking back, the 8x200m should have been alternating strong/relaxed and I swam steady for each set.  Regardless, I did get the work in and I with the bit of rest in between, I was consistently hitting the wall in 18 seconds for the 25m fast reps.

After the swim, I rode for 45 minutes before getting home.

I rode again in the afternoon; 15 minutes to Carina's Office and then for an another 40 minutes just noodling through town.

My back does feel better today.

## FRIDAY JUL 9
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
60 minute easy spin on the trainer, the rollers, outside on any bike you like. Just make sure it's easy.

Run 30 minutes flat and easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

After work, I decided to do the run first.  The weather app said it was 25°C outside but a sign near the _Switch Bridge_ said 31°C.  It felt closer to the latter.  I ran easy up the _Lochside Trail_ and turned back after 16 minutes.  I was in a very comfortable groove on the way back and even split the run almost to the second.

Before dinner, I rode up _Highlands _ to _Barker Road_.  Easy spinning, even up some of the punchy hills on the way out and a fun descent on the way out of the park.

My back did better again today.
