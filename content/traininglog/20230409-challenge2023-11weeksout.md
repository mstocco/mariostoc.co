A practically empty pool apart from 4 triathletes.  A conversation broke out; 3 of us have scheduled races on June 25th (others doing Coeur d'Alene).

Hosted the family for Easter Dinner and once the day was done, I went to bed instead of sitting on the trainer.

Ride 60 minutes EASY. 
Great day for the trainer. But any bike, inside or out, will work. 

Mobility 25 minutes.

### NOTES
Time: **79 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **131W**

I loaded the Super League London Race on YouTube for entertainment. Steady effort on the trainer with one bio-break at 30 minutes.

At 76 minutes, my right foot said, "No mas!"

Reviewing the L/R balance data, the foot was hinting that it was getting tired.

Still walking with lots of care and still barely kicking while in the water.

One of the 150m reps was extended to 200m; my body was in _Crystal Pool_ but my head was in _Elk Lake_.  Good times.

I thought about riding the trainer but I am feeling the swim this evening.

Aim for rolling terrain. 
Water front or the goose would be two solid options. 
Easy to steady effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **128 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **Trainer** 

Dentist appointment 1400 that ran long; The result being a referral to a root specialist.

By the time I got home, I was really hungry and not in much of a mood for dodging showers.  I finally jumped on the trainer at 1900.  I loaded up Rouvy and after a 7 minute warm-up, I rode a measured effort of the first 2 hours of the simulated Roth course.
