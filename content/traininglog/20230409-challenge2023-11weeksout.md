# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, April 9, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**11** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Swim, bike and heal.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **13 Hours**

I feel like I was **DUATHLETE in training**

Despite an incomplete day on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');), 
I pulled off a **solid week** with my longest swim and longest 
ride of the year (so far).

My cuboid has local swelling and a hint of discolouration. 
Walking is just starting to become natural, with less of a 
limp BUT I am not ready to kick in the pool and the voice in 
my head says "don't even think about running, even to cross 
a street."

On the trainer, I re-load the _"Roth Bike Course"_ to keep the 
route _"fresh"_ in my head this week.

A practically empty pool apart from 4 triathletes.  A

25th (others doing Coeur d'Alene).

Hosted the family for Easter Dinner and once the day was done, 
I was ready for bed.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes EASY. 
Great day for the trainer. But any bike, inside or out, will work. 

Mobility 25 minutes.

### NOTES
Time: **79 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **131W**

I loaded the Super League London Race on YouTube for 
entertainment. Steady effort on the trainer with one bio-break 
at 30 minutes.

At 76 minutes, my right foot said, "No mas!"

Reviewing the L/R balance data, the foot was hinting that it 
was getting tired.  Started ~50/50 and gradually measured to 
around ~61/39.

Still walking with lots of care and still barely kicking while 
in the water.

One of the 150m reps was extended to 200m; my body was in 
_Crystal Pool_ but my head was in _Elk Lake_.  Good times.

I thought about riding the trainer but I am feeling the swim 
this evening.

## WEDNESDAY APR 12 üå§Ô∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:00 on MTB or Road bike. 
Aim for rolling terrain. 
Water front or the goose would be two solid options. 
Easy to steady effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **128 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **Trainer** 

Dentist appointment 1400 that ran long; The result being a 
referral to a root specialist.

By the time I got home, I was really hungry and not in much of 
a mood for dodging showers.  I finally jumped on the trainer 
at 1900.  I loaded up Rouvy and after a 7 minute warm-up, I 
rode a measured effort of the first 2 hours of the simulated 
Roth course.

## THURSDAY APR 13 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2800: 
2 rounds (100 easy free/smooth. R :20, 50 steady w/ buoy. R :10) 
4x 50 Paddle-fist drill w/ focus on high elbow catch. R :20.

24x 50 as 2 @ Strong-high turnover-high focus, 1 @ EASY.  R :20 after each. 
200 super relaxed and easy to cool down.

Mobility 21 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **74 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **3050m**

I swam the first 1900m in the 50m lanes.  Had a really curious 
pain in my right ankle join; not the cuboid but enough to slow 
me down.  The pain cleared by the time I started in the 25m 
lanes so who knows.

High turnover nets me about 5 seconds per 50m; lots of extra 
work for not a whole lot of time.

## FRIDAY APR 14 üå§
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes. 
Rolling terrain. Same as Wednesday, but not as long. 
Easy to steady effort. Getting in some good volume this week.

### NOTES
Time: **90 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **130W**

Finished work later so I jumped on Rouvy and continued where I 
left off [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');).  Unlike that 
ride, tonight I felt better than typical and rode a bit more 
pressure on the pedals.

This simulation does seem to align with my real-world 
expectations.  Example, if I combine these 2 rides, I'd finish 
the first lap in about ~3:05:00.  Let's say a second lap is 
~3:15:00.  Add 7 minutes to get to the turn off at _Eckersm√ºhlen_ 
then 8 minutes into T2.

~6:35:00 is believable considering the bike times at 
[Ironman Italy](/racereports/2021-ironman-italy-emilia-romagna) and 
[Ironman Canada](/racereports/2022-ironman-canada-penticton). 
Time will tell.

## SATURDAY APR 15 üåß
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Long ride on MTB.   
3:30-3:50. Easy to steady ride. On the Goose would be great. 
Fueling early and often. 
Drinking often. 
Dressing to stay warm! (and dry)

### NOTES
Moving Time: **275 Mins** &nbsp; Ride: **92 km**

West on _The Goose_ and I could feel [yesterday](javascript:flick('fri');) 
lingering in my legs.  I pressed on looking at the foreshadowing grey sky. 
I reached the _Sooke Road_ crossing with 15 minutes until my turnaround 
time.  That turnaround point came and went as I pressed on.  I was 
feeling pretty good, I had lots of very sugary water and gels and the 
weather was tolerable.

At the 52km marker, a nice spot opened up above the _Sooke River_. 
I stopped for 10 minutes, had a gel then put on the gore-tex for 
the trip back to Victoria.
<!----->
This afternoon, I finally became reacquainted with a dull ache 
in my quads; something that I haven't felt since 
[Penticton](/racereports/2022-ironman-canada-penticton).  My 
ischial tuberosities were also extremely disappointed with my 
decision to ride longer than scheduled.

#### SOOKE POTHOLES
![Bike](/assets/jpg/bike-20230415.jpeg)

I stopped to urinate a lot today.  At one point on the trip 
back, I wasn't getting more than 6km down the trail before the 
urge had me pulled over (again).  Rural _Galloping Goose_ is 
awesome for this.

76.6 Kg before the ride, just 76.4 afterwards.
