Week beginning [Sunday, May 2, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

## SUNDAY MAY 2 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.   
Run 1:20. Easy effort. Maybe on some dirt on flatter trails at Thetis. Elk lake or the dirt section of the Goose would also be nice. Or just cruising Panama Flats area. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **83 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **13.5 km**

Good sleep last night.

I took most of the day as a personal reset day.  I worked on getting this training log caught back up to date, gave my self a haircut at chilled out on the deck.

For the run, it was **easy effort** for the entire duration.  I noticed that I left my footpod at home.  While I was close enough to go back and get it, I decided otherwise.  I did not need an accurate pace to accomplish this run's objective.
<!---->
It was close to dinner when I left too.  Before heading out the door, I had a gel and I packed a 500ml bottle of Maurten 320 with me.

I drank every 10 minutes and was empty at the 60 minute mark.  There was little intensity and zero GI.  I did notice the residual lemonade was setting off the Maurten; the consistency was getting thicker as the bottle emptied.

Piriformis held up; tomorrow will be a better tell.

2 bananas and I was out the door, pedalling into a cold headwind to the pool.

I felt just okay in the pool this morning.  On the sighting lengths, I practiced almost exclusively picking my head up when breathing on my left; it is just a bit more awkward on that side for me.
<!---->
The ladder was swam with consistency; the kicking was a thigh-burner and probably the best medicine for a sketchy piriformis.

![Swim Paces](/assets/jpg/swim-20210503.jpeg)
I **finished strong** getting the last 100m in 1:36.8; pretty close to my best _"rested"_ time in a 25m pool.

---

I woke up with the 1975 song __"Slow Ride"__ by the British rock band _Foghat_ in a perpetual loop in my head.  How awesome is that?

_I'm in the mood_  
_The rhythm is right_  
_Move to the music_   
_We can roll all night, yeah_  

_Slow ride, take it easy_...

## TUESDAY MAY THE 4TH <span style="font-size:0.6em">be with you, always.</span>  ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **6** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.  Ride 75 minutes. Spin 20-25 minutes easy.

This can be off the bike, but it can also be to start/end the day.

### NOTES
<mark>Total Time: **0 minutes** &nbsp;</mark>

My right ankle is experiencing some lingering soreness (run on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');)) and my piriformis (left) continues to hint that it still needs consideration, even though it felt good [yesterday](javascript:flick('mon');) after the swim and short ride home.

This day went from good to bad at 11am.  Work is trying to remove me from technical support duties but...  I worked late and missed another training day.

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2200m**   
Work was still on my mind at 0300 this morning.
<!---->
Given that I was awake anyway, I did a bit of extra research and sent off an email _before_ pedalling to the pool.

Once in the water, I calmed down and got to work.  The lanes were pretty open this morning compared to recent days and I was able to take advantage of that when it came to the fixed time reps (leaving every 2:15).

Those 8 fixed time reps were paced fairly consistently:   **1:51**, **1:52**, **1:51**, **1:49**, **1:52**, **1:52**, **1:48** and finished with a **1:47.6** 

![Swim Paces](/assets/jpg/swim-20210505.jpeg) Garmin thinks I set a PR for the 400m (7:27) but I won't count it because I was using a buoy.

I rode home after the swim and jumped on the rollers with the TT Bike for 30 minutes.  I wanted to be close to home because we have the plumbers scheduled for this morning to work in the bathroom and I have meetings scheduled for work.
