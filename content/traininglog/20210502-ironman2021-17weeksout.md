### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.   
Run 1:20. Easy effort. Maybe on some dirt on flatter trails at Thetis. Elk lake or the dirt section of the Goose would also be nice. Or just cruising Panama Flats area. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **83 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **13.5 km**

Good sleep last night.

I took most of the day as a personal reset day.  I worked on getting this training log caught back up to date, gave my self a haircut at chilled out on the deck.

For the run, it was **easy effort** for the entire duration.  I noticed that I left my footpod at home.  While I was close enough to go back and get it, I decided otherwise.  I did not need an accurate pace to accomplish this run's objective.

It was close to dinner when I left too.  Before heading out the door, I had a gel and I packed a 500ml bottle of Maurten 320 with me.

I drank on every 10 minutes and was empty at the 60 minute mark.  There was little intensity and zero GI.  I did notice the residual lemonade was setting off the Maurten; the consistency was getting thicker as the bottle emptied.
