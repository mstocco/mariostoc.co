# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, June 11, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**2** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Get to, then adjust to life in N√ºrnberg. 

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **13&frac34; Hours**

I feel like I was **FLYING HIGH**

After a great ride on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');), it was time to pack up and fly to Germany.

New bike, new bike box and lots of experimenting to get things disassembled and packed securely for the trip.  Everything arrived in one piece albeit on the last flight of the day.

Being back in N√ºrnberg is awesome.

![Definitely an awesome pool to get a workout in.  Thursday, I did 2700&#8239;m here and Saturday it was a PB 4300&#8239;m.](/assets/jpg/IMG_4969-977x550.jpeg N√ºrnbergBad - Stadionbad)

[Yesterday](challenge2023-3weeksout?sat), I popped the chain off my bike, stripped it clean and applied _"Squirt"_ on it.  This is the first time I am using a drip wax on a chain and the first time using wax on the road.  Bike chains are only waxed on the track.

Today's ride was probably the route my coach asked for [last Sunday](challenge2023-3weeksout?sun).

I headed out on the _E&N Rail Trail_ and struck up a conversation with an random roadie on his way to _Colwood_; he had never taken this bike path before.
<!----->
I loosely followed last week's route but spent less time on the hills.  For example, I rode a fraction of the hills around _Labonne Road_ and took _Ross-Durrance Road_ instead of the top part of _Munn_.

I fuelled with a bottle with just 2 packets of _Tailwind_ stretched with sugar; it sat better but still wasn't great tasting.  The second bottle was my typical lemonade, mixed thick.

I looped the peninsula via _Lands End Road_ before heading south.  Overall, I **felt pretty good** today; maybe a little in saddle area...

Getting things organized for the flight overseas is **priority one**.  I am feeling pressure of the trip because I am getting more forgetful as the day wears on.

No walk or stretching but with a tiny window at _Crystal Pool_, I got in some lengths; nothing structured, nothing long, just doing what I can to get some purposeful movement in without piling on more stress.

Lufthansa had my bike case **right beside me** before we left _Frankfurt's Terminal 1_ for a bus ride out to the plane.  The bike sat there while we departed for N√ºrnberg.

For the rest of the afternoon, my _Apple AirTag_ informed me as the bike moved about _Frankfurt Airport_, out to the _"Lost & Found"_ area in  _Terminal 2_ before heading back to other side of _Terminal 1_ later in the evening.

We took the _U-Bahn_ back to the airport to retrieve the bike at **midnight** as it was sent on the day's last flight.

Not cool Lufthansa.  üò°

A [50m outdoor pool](javascript:flkty.select(2);)?  Let's go!
<!----->
The stadium swimming _"baths"_ were part of a large sports and leisure park created in the 1920s.  Originally a 100&#8239;m pool and diving platform, it remained undamaged during WW2 and it was refurbished into the park it is today in 1999.

The pools are made from stainless steel and I found that with a little bit of sunshine, I could see my form in the reflection off the bottom.  The water temperature was maybe a touch cooler than the competition pool at _Commonwealth Pool_ back home.

Today, I **felt fast** in the water.  I did the workout from memory and missed two of the four easy lengths in between the 10x100m sets.

---

Walked roughly 8&#8239;km to and from the pool plus a night walking the around the _Altstadt_.

---

Bike is mostly built; I just need to align the callipers to be ready for [tomorrow](javascript:flick('fri');).

Carina's second cousin, Martin is a cyclist and he took me for a tour of the N√ºrnberg area this afternoon.

<!----->
It took a short time to exit the city but once we did, I was introduced to the cycling infrastructure like I'd haven't seen.  Bike paths for seemingly endless miles alongside the main highways.

We made our way northeast through the village of _R√ºckersdorf_, then northwesterly through the _G√ºnthersb√ºler Forst_ before landing in Martin's hometown of _Heroldsberg_.  We then travelled through Carina's father's home village of _Buchenb√ºhl_ before returning to _N√ºrnberg_.  

Riding with Martin was a lot of fun.  Although we went over the allotted time (~45 minutes), the effort was super easy.

---

We spent some time visiting after the ride and once I did get my runners on, I felt really good cruising on the pedestrian path along _M√ºnchener Stra√üe_.
