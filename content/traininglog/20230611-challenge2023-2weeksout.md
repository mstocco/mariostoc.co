Probably the route my coach asked for [last Sunday](challenge2023-3weeksout?sun).

I headed out on the _E&N Rail Trail_ with an random roadie on his way to _Colwood_ from the _John Dean_ area.  He had never taken this bike path before and we talked about my upcoming event in [Roth](/racereports/2023-challenge-roth).

From there, I loosely followed last week's route but spent less time on the hills.  For example, I rode a fraction of _Labonne Road_ and took _Ross-Durrance Road_ instead of the top part of _Munn_.

I fuelled with a bottle with just 2 packets of _Tailwind_ stretched with sugar; it sat better but still wasn't great tasting.  The second bottle was my typical lemonade, mixed thick.

I looped the peninsula via _Lands End Road_ before heading south.  Overall, I felt pretty good today.

Getting things organized for the flight overseas is priority one.  I know I am feeling pressure because I am getting forgetful as the day wears on.

I had a tiny window to go to _Crystal Pool_ and just do some lengths; nothing structured, doing what I can to get some purposeful movement in without piling on more stress.
