CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, April 16, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**10** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Same as [last week](challenge2023-11weeksout), swim, bike, heal.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **14 Hours**

I feel like I was **RIDING BIKES**

Without the added stress of running, I am feeling like the bike fitness is starting to develop.

Despite still only using one leg at the wall, this might have been the first week that I started to feel a little more connected in the pool too.

Velofix delivered my new TT Bike on [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');).  There are still a few things to sort on it, saddle, handlebar tape and aerobar tweaks.  About an hour on the road and I am feeling consciously competent with the full-synchro Di2 shifting on this bike.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

Trainer ~ 60 minutes. EASY spinning. 
One of the TT bikes would be great, up to you.

### NOTES
Total Time: **71 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **3200m**

Quads very much affected by the fun I had [yesterday](challenge2023-11weeksout?sat). 
Dead bugs before the pool let me know that my right hip flexor 
and my left QL are annoyed with me today as well.
<!---->
The pool was a chaotic this afternoon.  _Mercury Rinsing_ took 
over a couple lanes and my next best fit was in a lane that 
was moving faster than is typical for me.  I'd do okay hanging 
off feet for a length but with a single leg push off the wall, 
I was left behind.  

To slot in, I would stop/start the activity on the watch so my 
rest times were off too.  This felt like a race.

Heartrate data accounted for the missing 200m.

Not much energy left for the trainer.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 70 minutes EASY. 
On the trainer, or outside, on any bike you like.

### NOTES
Total Time: **76 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **128W**

New TT Bike was delivered today.  I futzed with adjusting the 
seat and aerobars, getting measurements close to my original 
bike.  I didn't take it outside; the weather was dry but very 
windy and very cold.

After dinner, I jumped on the trainer and started riding Rouvy 
where I last left off on the Roth bike course.  The app crashed 
about 15 minutes in but I did have the activity being recorded 
simultaneously on my head unit.  It was 15 minutes of simulated 
terrain then an hour of steady, easy effort pedalling.

### NOTES
Total Time: **61 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2700m**

Weight over the past 5 days has trended in the wrong 
direction. It has incremented a little bit each day, 
from 76.0 Kg late last week, to 77.6 this morning.

This no running injury is messing with my mood.
<!----->
Or maybe its just the cold, wet weather.  Snow on the _Malahat_ 
this morning.

Jumping into a 50m lane to start the workout, I found out how 
hard the swim on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) was. 
Shoulders, triceps and lats were less than comfortable with 
movement.  I did attempt the 100m kick; no pain during but I 
was about 45 seconds slower for the 100m; glad I tried it, 
glad to only to have to do one.

Despite today's stiff upper body, I did my best with the 50m 
fast reps.  The effort was there, the times were anything but 
fast.

I got 3 of 5 of the main set in before the lane change over. 
Straight to the restroom, straight back into the pool (25m). 
I was not up for more hard efforts so I swam an easy 300 then 
an easy 200 and called it a day.

I saw Batu on the way out; he confirmed that his workout 
[last Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) (I shared the lane 
with) was fast for him and his swim partner.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Long Ride on a week day. 
Ride 2:15. Ideally on the road bike or the MTB. Why???
Because the next goal is to seek out around 500 meters of total climbing. So you don't have to only climb, but it would be nice if you headed to a smaller hill and made a few trips up. And then cruised the flats when you're done. 
Effort is just 'Steady uphill chugging" Aka: Stronger than a flat road spin, but we are NOT sprinting up the hill. Just a good solid effort. 

Eat lots. Drink lots. Have fun.

### NOTES
Total Time: **135 Minutes** &nbsp; Accent: **676m**

I headed up to the fire roads of _Thetis Park_ paying attention 
to the total ascent metric on the head unit.  I stayed off the 
single track initially, sticking with the goal of getting metres.
<!----->
Pacing the climb up _Scafe Hill Trail_ got me a PR on the 
Strava Segement _"Twin Peaks"_.  Just a few months ago, 
getting up this hill in one go was beyond my fitness.

Back down to _Bellamy Trail_ then to the gate at _Davies Road_ 
in just under an hour with 420m of gain in the bank.  I looped 
back to the park via _Frank's Trail_.  I took a short venture 
off the fire road via _"Better Than The Road"_ and looked at 
_"Mostly Open"_ before the voice in my head reminded me that 
injuries are not my friend.

Although I was dry, I certainly needed to put on the gilet for 
the trip off the hill; it is still cooler than it should be. 

Solid ride and I am feeling far more refreshed afterwards, 
unlike [last Saturday](challenge2023-11weeksout?sat).

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 3100:
2x 100 easy swim. Rest as needed.
2x 100 swim w/ buoy. rest as needed.
6x 50 Paddle-fist drill. R :20.
4x 50 gradual build easy to strong. R :20.
7x 300 as 75 smooth/relaxed/25 w/ higher turnover/higher focus. R 1:00 between each. 
2x 50 easy swimming to cool down.

Mobility 16 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **3100m**

Overall, I felt better in the pool today with a touch (slightly) more effort going into the kick.  I forgot the paddles and replaced with the fist drill.  

Lane change fell just before the half way point of the workout and the lifeguards were not as quick as the last few weeks.  Regardless, I got the full distance in ending right as the lane reservations kicked in (4pm).

Every 300m lane became progressively easier, feeling more connected with the act of swimming.  I was pretty happy with this time in the water.

Weather was blustery; I drove to the pool.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes. Flat to rolling route. 
Ideally on the TT bike. 
Keep the effort EASY!

### NOTES
Total Saddle Time: **~90 Minutes**

First venture out of the neighbourhood with the new TT Bike.  I brought a torque wrench with me and I did need to adjust the saddle once.  I am going to replace it with the Selle Italia Watt saddle on the old bike before the next outdoor ride. 

Jumped on the trainer for 30 minutes because I was home early.

## SATURDAY APR 22
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Long Ride on MTB. 
Goal: 4 hours. Easy to steady pedaling. 
Allowed: Making it to the Redgate. This may be over five hours of pedaling. That is ok, as long as you're having a good time, and the body is holding up. 
Fuel early. Fuel often. 
Hydrate as much as needed. 
Dress to stay warm and dry.

### NOTES
Total Time: **325 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **102 km**

I watched IM Texas through to the 30km mark of the women's race.  Finally a bit more texture to the rain clouds out west; time to pedal the bike.

I focused on being strict with the effort for the ride out toward _Matheson Lake_.  An odd slight tailwind pushed me west and I felt like I was making better time compared to [last week](challenge2023-11weeksout?sat) because of it.
<!----->
Pee breaks were as plentiful as last week too, urges coming in pretty much the same points on the trail too.  Hooray for consistency. 

Bottles had my [Lemonade Recipe](/blog/lemonade-recipe) mixed to a 100g ratio and I packed a bag of _Maynards Fuzzy Peach_ with me.  I thought I noticed the extra sugar in the first hour but no gut issues.

2 Hours to the first (smaller) trestle heading up to [The Red Gate](javascript:flkty.select(2);).  From this point on the way back home, it took me 2 hours and 7 minutes.

I had the same dull ache in my quads as last week except it came on a little later and a little less intense (to start).  By the time I crossed _Rocky Point Road_, I was getting wet, a little cold and the false flat effort coming up from _Matheson Lake_ really was the end game for the quads.

Another solid ride (for me) in the books.
