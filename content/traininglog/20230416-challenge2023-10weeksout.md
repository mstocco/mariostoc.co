### NOTES
Total Time: **71 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **3200m**

Quads very much affected by the fun I had [yesterday](challenge2023-11weeksout?sat).  Dead bugs before the pool let me know that my right hip flexor and my left QL are annoyed with me today as well.

The pool was a chaotic this afternoon.  _Mercury Rinsing_ took over a couple lanes and my next best fit was in a lane that was moving faster than is typical for me.  I'd do okay hanging off feet for a length but with a single leg push off the wall, I was left behind.  

To slot in, I would stop/start the activity on the watch so my rest times were off too.  This felt like a race.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 70 minutes EASY. 
On the trainer, or outside, on any bike you like.

### NOTES
Total Time: **76 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **128W**

New TT Bike was delivered today.  I futzed with adjusting the seat and aerobars, getting measurements close to my original bike.  I didn't take it outside; the weather was dry but very windy and very cold.

After dinner, I jumped on the trainer and started riding Rouvy where I last left off on the Roth bike course.  The app crashed about 15 minutes in but I did have the activity being recorded simultaneously on my head unit.  It was 15 minutes of simulated terrain then an hour of steady, easy effort pedalling.

### NOTES
Total Time: **61 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2700m**

Weight over the past 5 days has trended in the wrong direction, incrementing a little bit each day from 76.0 Kg [last Friday](challenge2023-11weeksout?fri) to 77.6 this morning.  This _"no running"_ injury is messing with my mood too.  

Or maybe its just the cold, wet weather.  Snow on the _Malahat_ this morning.

Jumping into a 50m lane to start the workout, I found out how hard the swim on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) was.  Shoulders, triceps and lats were less than comfortable with movement.  I did attempt the 100m kick; no pain during but I was about 45 seconds slower for the 100m; glad I tried it, glad to only to have to do one.

Despite today's stiff upper body, I did my best with the 50m fast reps.  The effort was there, the times were anything but fast.

I got 3 of 5 of the main set in before the lane change over.  Straight to the restroom, straight back into the pool (25m).  I was not up for more hard efforts so I swam an easy 300 then an easy 200 and called it a day.

I saw Batu on the way out, he confirmed that his workout on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) that I was sharing the lane with was hard for him and his swim partner.

## WEDNESDAY APR 19 üå¶
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Long Ride on a week day. 
Ride 2:15. Ideally on the road bike or the MTB. Why???
Because the next goal is to seek out around 500 meters of total climbing. So you don't have to only climb, but it would be nice if you headed to a smaller hill and made a few trips up. And then cruised the flats when you're done. 
Effort is just 'Steady uphill chugging" Aka: Stronger than a flat road spin, but we are NOT sprinting up the hill. Just a good solid effort. 

Eat lots. Drink lots. Have fun.

### NOTES
Total Time: **135 Minutes** Accent: **600m**

Coin flip to decide the XC bike or the new TT Bike...  XC bike for the win.

I headed up to the fire roads of _Thetis Park_ paying attention to the total ascent metric on the head unit.  I stayed off the single track initially, sticking with the goal of getting metres.

Pacing the climb up _Scafe Hill Trail_ got me a PR on the Strava Segement _"Twin Peaks"_.  Just a few months ago, getting up this hill in one go was beyond my fitness.

Back down to _Bellamy Trail_ then to the gate at _Davies Road_ in just under an hour with 420m of gain in the bank.  I looped back to the park via _Frank's Trail_.  I took a short venture off the fire road via _"Better Than The Road"_ and looked at _"Mostly Open"_ before the voice in my head reminded me that injuries are not my friend.

Although I was dry, I certainly needed to put on the gilet for the trip off the hill; it is still cooler than it should be. 

Solid ride and I am not feeling shattered like [Saturday](challenge2023-11weeksout?sat).
