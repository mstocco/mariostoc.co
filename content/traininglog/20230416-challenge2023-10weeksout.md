## WEDNESDAY APR 19
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Long Ride on a week day. 
Ride 2:15. Ideally on the road bike or the MTB. Why???
Because the next goal is to seek out around 500 meters of total climbing. So you don't have to only climb, but it would be nice if you headed to a smaller hill and made a few trips up. And then cruised the flats when you're done. 
Effort is just 'Steady uphill chugging" Aka: Stronger than a flat road spin, but we are NOT sprinting up the hill. Just a good solid effort. 

Eat lots. Drink lots. Have fun.
