### PLANNED WORKOUT
Just a nice easy run.

### NOTES
Total Time: **33 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **5.4 km**

Terrible sleep.  Night sweats and a headache kept me uncomfortable last night.  I had 2 bananas at 0200 and toast and jam at 0400 to help get through the night.

I did the latest  Body Weight Warrior Full Body routine and my hamstrings and glutes were tighter than I have ever remembered.  Quads and hipflexors were in a happy spot however.

Mid-afternoon, I laced up my shoes and did go for my first run since [IRONMAN Italy](/racereports/2021-ironman-italy-emilia-romagna) a whole **21 days ago**.   I kept it very easy and it felt incredible to move again.  The weather was nice and that helped.
