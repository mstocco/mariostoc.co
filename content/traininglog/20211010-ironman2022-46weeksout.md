# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, October 10, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**46** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Time to get going.  My goal is just to (re)start the plan

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **100 mins** &nbsp; Running: **17.2 km**

I feel like I **SPUTTERED** (a bit)

This week was to be my jumpstart to getting back into a routine.  I sort of got there with 3 runs and 2 much needed mobility sessions.  Bike and swim are re-introduced [ironman2020-45weeksout](next week).  The weather was mostly grey and wet and that didn't help.

Work has been busy and I am getting some work done around the house too.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Just a nice easy run.

### NOTES
Total Time: **33 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **5.4 km**

Terrible sleep.  Night sweats and a headache kept me uncomfortable last night.  I had 2 bananas at 0200 and toast and jam at 0400 to help get through the night.

I did the latest  Body Weight Warrior Full Body routine and my hamstrings and glutes were tighter than I have ever remembered.  Quads and hipflexors were in a happy spot however.

Mid-afternoon, I laced up my shoes and did go for my first run since [IRONMAN Italy](/racereports/2021-ironman-italy-emilia-romagna) a whole **21 days ago**.   I kept it very easy and it felt incredible to move again.  The weather was nice and that helped.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Afternoon run with Yauki.  

### NOTES
Total Time: **49 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **8.4 km**

Despite the light rain, I met Yauki at his house and we did a counterclockwise lap along the _Songhees Walkway_, going up the hill on _Lampson Street_ first.  Yauki tends to run a touch faster than I would if I was on a run by myself; he is also looking to run with someone a touch slower so he can run more frequently.  That pacing was pretty much how this run worked out.

_Vastus Medialis_ on both legs became **tender** and when Yauki wanted to walk after 8km, I was good with it.  We walked 13 minutes back to our neighbourhood.   No other aches and judging by my recorded (perceived) heart rate, there was work being done.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Time to set up the rollers.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

I slept soundly despite working until 2300 last night.

After work, I went to the garage to prep my road bike for a ride and while pumping up my front tire, its valve extender unthreaded itself.  Tire removed, extender retreaded and then to re-glue the tire back on the rim; I ran out of desire to go for a ride.  A sore throat and general aching feeling plus the grey skies didn't help either.

Instead, I worked on the front yard (repairing a neglected lawn) until dark.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash;  

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Not the best sleep.  Up at 0300 hungry and congested; I had 2 bananas and finally fell back asleep.

The time on the bike was missed.  I ended up repairing an unseated valve extender on a tubular rim and once I was done playing mechanic, I lost any desire to ride.  I spent the rest of the daylight repairing the damage of this past summer's drought to my front lawn; one household task complete.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 60 minutes  

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes**

Long day at work but I did make time for the mobility routine.  It was a good stretch that highlighted that I have work to do with my glutes and hammies.

I did get a bit more of my house chores done by dismantling another section of our old chimney.

## SATURDAY OCT 16 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **1** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
45 minute run; easy and flat.  
Mobility: 15 minute runners routine.

### NOTES
Run Time: **51	 Minutes**  &nbsp; Avg Pace: **5:53/km**

The weather forecast called for an _"atmospheric river"_ and although the day started wet and grey, the sun came out and we had a really nice day in _Victoria_.

I ran slightly longer than what was scheduled _(~5 minutes)_ getting past the _Johnson Street Bridge_ before turning for home.  The adjectives **light and effortless** could easily be used to describe the trip to into town and back.  Maybe the warm sunshine had something to do with that.

My hamstrings and glutes were tight and I did roll them out before putting on the trainers.  With that, I focused on breath work while on the bike path today.

The mobility routine was done after the run.
