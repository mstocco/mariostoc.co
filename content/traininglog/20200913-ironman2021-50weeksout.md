# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, September 13, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(3);)

**50 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am expecting the smoky skies to clear this week and get back 
to putting some consistency into into my fitness.  This is 
another week to build on good habits and get a 
[test of where I am at](javascript:flkty.select(10)).

## SUMMARY
I feel like I was **MOVING FORWARD**.

The start and end of the work week, I struggled with my energy. 
Part of that is the load at work and part of that is on me. 
After acknowledging those two days, I have five other days 
that I can look back on that tell a story of me bouncing back 
to a more consistent routine. Mobility and strides were put 
back into place this week.  I also got a new pair of shoes 
that are fun to run in.

I did have a few moments of sadness throughout this week too.

## SUNDAY SEP 13
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 20 minutes: Swimmer's Routine  
Run 50-55 minutes. Easy effort. Hilly route. On trails is 
great, but not mandatory.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

Another very smoky day, another day waking up not feeling 
rested and a headache worthy of an 200mg Advil.

I rolled out the yoga mat and got a good stretch in. 
Swimmer's routine showed me that my neck and traps are very 
tender, that my pecs and hamstrings are tight (but not sore) 
and that my hip flexors and quads have decent mobility.

With the smoke lingering, I substituted the 55 minute run with 
a 90 minute walk down to (and up from) [McKenzie Bight](/pictures/victoria/mckenzie-bight "McKenzie Bight") 
with Carina.  
Distance: **5.7 km** &nbsp; Elevation: **240 m**

## MONDAY SEP 14
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes  
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I was up really early (4am) so I checked in on a few things at 
work.  That early start meant I got a morning nap between 
06:30 and 08:00; from there I was ready to take on the Monday.

Flexibility Routine V3! showed me that my hamstrings are tight 
and the straddle positions at the end of the routine were 
challenging too.  My quads, adductors and hipflexors are GTG.

Today was another smoky day but a light rain started at 16:30; 
hopefully that will clear out the air. Regardless of the rain, 
I struggled with motivation this evening and ended up spending
time on the keyboard and not going for my run.

## TUESDAY SEP 15
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:00-1:15. Easy spin on the road bike. If you are 
crunched for time... 45-60 minutes of easy spinning on the 
rollers. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 minutes**

I had an _"ok"_ sleep last night but today was a bit of a 
frustrating day at work as I did get myself into a grumpy 
state by not stopping for lunch at a decent time.

I did 50 minutes of steady state pedalling this evening, using 
the road bike on the rollers.  The top of my right knee cap 
was _mildly tender_ through the first 24 minutes and from then 
on, everything felt good.  At least until the saddle started 
to become noticable after ~40 minutes. The tire pressure was 
low for rollers so (I think) it was a good workout. I chose 
rollers over outside because of the lingering smoke in the air.

## WEDNESDAY SEP 16
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 22 minutes  
Run 40 minutes: 15 minutes easy running to warm up. 10x :40 
strides, 1:20 easy jog after each. HR should drop fairly close 
to your easy run HR by the start of the next stride. (with in 
5-10 beats) If it's not, then stride slower. 5 minutes easy to 
cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

Sleep last night was ok but I did wake up feeling congested 
and with a stiff neck.

I got the run in after work this evening.  Weird day as it 
looked like the smoke was going to lift in the morning but it 
got thicker as the afternoon wore on.  The last of the sun was 
visible as a dim, crimson dot in the sky at 17:45 and gone 
completely by 18:00.  Regardless, I put on an N95 dust mask 
and headed out.

<!---->
This was one of those runs that felt good in the beginning but 
as soon as the work started, I really wished that I had put in 
some real training last weekend.  Regardless, I made it _"Last 
stride, best stride"_ and enjoyed a walk for the final 1:20 
recovery period.

I have to say, running with a mask sure had me aware of my 
breathing.

Distance: **7.5 km** &nbsp; Pace: **5:35/km** &nbsp; Time: **42:00**

I did the Cyclist Flexibility Routine _after_ the run; which 
served to highlight my asymmetries!

## THURSDAY SEP 17

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

New shoe day!  A pair of Nike Zoom Fly 3 in _"Volt/Smoke Grey"_
came in the mail today.

I got a revised run from Elliot before heading out; a bit of 
structure and a chance to open up was added to the run.  I was 
a tiny bit tender (glutes/quads/calves) from yesterday but 
nothing  that was out of the ordinary.  New shoes didn't take 
much to get u sed to but a second day up on my toes might 
require a bit of massage later tonight.

Other than the run, I had a solid sleep last night, a solid 
(productive) day at work and spent some time working out the 
tight spots in my back with my massage chair.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes  
Rollers ~ 30 minutes. EASY spinning.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Another pretty good sleep last night but I am stiff (mostly 
lower body) from the past couple of days.

As the day became the evening, I ran out of engery (mentally 
and physically) and whiffed on getting out to the garage for 
a ride on the rollers.

No television tonight either, I am going to bed early on 
this Friday night.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Morning: 5-15 minutes of basic mobility (of your choice) to 
loosen up for the day.   
Drive to the track    
10 minutes easy jogging. 6x 100 strides, Ideally @ a touch 
SLOWER than 5k speed. Yes, these are pretty slow. Goal is to 
warm up. 100 meter EASY jog between each.  
Then... 200 meters @ what you think you might hold for a 5k. 
Walk 200-400 meters. Bathroom, tighten shoes, water, etc.
 
5k Time Trial! Lap splits would be great. But not mandatory. 
5 minutes walking. Then 10 minutes EASY jogging to cool down

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

I feel rested enough but last night wasn't the easiest sleep; 
sadness is still coming and going and I don't have an answer 
for it except to just

<!---->
accept that is still my reality at this point.

The mobility routine I chose before heading out was Tom Merrick's 
[20 Minute Full Body Flexibility Routine](https://youtu.be/lPKRiU9u_Hc).

The weather today was a humid 18&#8451; (64&#8457;) with a 
breeze from the south west.

So at PISE (a local running track), it was boys soccer that 
had the infield this afternoon; that meant I'd have an 
audience of kids and parents to watch me suffer for a bit. 
I only hope that I can be entertaning for them.

The warm up was done (so I thought) according to the write up 
and I felt good.  With my heartrate back down to normal, it 
was time to see where my fitness is at.

This was a tale of every second lap.  The start of the second 
lap, everything is good.  On the fourth lap, I have settled 
into a rhythm.  At the start of lap six, I am feeling the fade 
coming on.  On the eighth lap, life is starting to suck pretty 
bad and it is too early to be feeling this bad.

<!---->
On the 10th lap, I am REALLY fighting the urge to walk. 
_"Just two more laps then a back straight, I can do this!"_

Eleventh lap, I am just hanging on as I crossed the start-line 
on the home stretch; I again, press the lap button on my watch. 
I look and the lap indicator, it reads, _"12/12"_.  So if I 
have done 12, then I just have this back stretch to do.  I 
muster up a push that would make Tim Noakes proud and hit the 
_"stop button"_ as I cross the half lap line.  **20:54.8**

Sadly, I didn't realize that I shorted myself one lap until I 
got back to the truck for the drive home.  Damn it.

* Learn to count all the way to 12.

* Even if I didn't get the full distance in this afternoon, I do have lap time data and a good training stimulus out of the activity.
* Maybe slow down a bit on the _"warm up"_.
