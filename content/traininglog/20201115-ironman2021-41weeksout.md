# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, November 15, 2020](javascript:flick('sun');)

**41 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
[Last week](ironman2021-42weeksout), I saw a number of trigger-points and hotspots flare up.  My goal this week is to be more mindful regarding the maintenance work, do my best to stick to the plan and be healthy for the track workout [next Sunday](ironman2021-40weeksout).

I have quality run work scheduled [this Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) and again on [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');) and 2 pool sessions (COVID allowing).

### PLANNED WORKOUTS
Run 10 minutes easy to warm up. 10x 100 meter strides (about 5k effort) 100 meter EASY jog after each. 5x 800 meters @ 3:29-3:33 (basically 5k pace or so. Try to find that rhythm) Leaving on 5:00. (about 90 seconds walking recovery) 10 minute cool down jog.

Ride 75+ minutes on any bike you like. Trainer, rollers, MTB, road bike, TT bike. Keep it easy. Spin out the legs. Bring snacks.

### NOTES
Total Time: **173 minutes**

The wind and rain pelting the house woke me up at 0618.  After doing my business and recording my weight (79.3 Kg), I crawled back into bed and slept soundly through 0730.  I made banana pancakes then did the _"15 Minute Runner's Flexibility Routine"_ while breakfast settled.

Time to head to PISE.

With a left hamstring/glute getting a whole lot of attention yesterday and today, I was pretty sensitive to how this workout was going to unfold.  The warm up was a breeze on a breezy day.  No soreness to report anywhere.  I started to feel some tenderness, specifically high up on my left adductor, during the 10x100m efforts.  It was not so sore as to alter my gait;  I continued on.

Coming off a 10th stride, the first of the 5x800m efforts felt laboured.  The second and third felt more comfortable (comparatively) but the fourth 800m saw the workout catching up with me.  I messed up the recording of the workout by hitting the stop/start button as I crossed the line on the 4th 800 but the fifth effort was my most focused.

More importantly, that tender left adductor went unnoticed during the 800s but I did have a dull ache in that left side's piriformis.

### NORMALIZED PACE CHART
![Pace Chart](/assets/jpg/pacechart-20201115.jpeg)

I felt **really good** with how this run went.

### POST RUN
The Seahawks took another beating this week.  They play again this Thursday night, which makes [next Sunday](ironman2021-40weeksout) free for an important workout.

### POST GAME EASY SPIN
Average Heart Rate: **105 BPM**

After the game, I headed out to the garage and sat on my TT Bike for 75 minutes.  I watched a video called _"Iron Dad"_, the story of Alex Smith and his son Harrison's battle with muscular dystrophy.  They completed _Challenge Denmark_ together; very cool story.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
21 Minutes of mobility

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Garbage sleep last night and I woke with a headache to boot.

Mobility and a good amount of time spent with the foam roller working out that stubborn piriformis.

<p style="font-size:1rem;margin-bottom:0;color:#ff8c00" class="agencyvc">WIND WARNING for Coastal British Columbia</p><p style="color:#ff8c00;font-size:0.9em;border-top:1px solid #ff8c00;">A rapidly deepening area of low pressure will pass north of Vancouver Island on Tuesday morning while a fast moving cold front crosses the south coast.</p>
<p style="color:#ff8c00;font-size:0.9em;">
As the front races across the area, widespread and powerful gusty southerly winds will occur. Gusts in excess of 90 km/h are possible.  Winds will ease considerably following the passage of the cold front but will remain gusty into Tuesday afternoon.</p>

## TUESDAY NOV 17
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUTS
Swim @ 1pm 1900: 4 rounds (2x 50 easy swim, 50 w/ buoy, 50 kick w/ board, rest as needed) 6x (25 Stronger swim r :15, 75 relaxed/easier effort r :20) 4x 100 swim w/ buoy/steady r :20-:30. 4x 25 easy to cool down.

Run 30 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I stepped on the scale this morning and morning rhymes with **warning**.  79.5Kg (175lbs) and I have no interest in heading up Yellow Lake Pass at anything more than 160lbs.  I don't get it.  I have been monitoring my dinner portions lately and when I thought this bereavement weight-gain was going to plateau around 78Kg, the weight continues to piling on.  I understand that I have replaced some running duration with intensity lately, but I believe there is a problem.

### THE SWIM(S)
I shared the _"Moderate Lane"_ with 3 older ladies.  It didn't take too long before I had one sternly suggested that I book myself into the _"Fast Lane"_.  I have 3 more  sessions paid for in this lane but maybe I will re-evaluate based on the time of day I can get in.

The swim felt **comfortable** and fun.  I did make a mental mistake with the workout in that I did 4x100 kickboard instead of 4x100 swimming with a pull-buoy.  When I pressed stop on the watch, it had counted 1500m and I was sure that I needed 1900 for the workout.

I had time, and the entire section of the pool to myself, so I set off and did an easy, **constant effort** 400m.  Whether I thought I was short on the original workout or not, there was every reason to take advantage of the moment and to have fun while I was in the water.

### THE JOG
This was and felt like a true brick workout.  Heavy calves, probably from the 800m of kickboard work just sucked and even after 20 minutes, never came around.  The weather window I had was about to collapse so I headed back to my truck.
