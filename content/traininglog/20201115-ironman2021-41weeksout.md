# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, November 15, 2020](javascript:flick('sun');)

**41 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
[Last week](ironman2021-42weeksout), I saw a number of trigger-points and hotspots flare up.  My goal this week is to be more mindful regarding the maintenance work, do my best to stick to the plan and be healthy for the track workout [next Sunday](ironman2021-40weeksout).

I have quality run work scheduled [this Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) and again on [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');) and 2 pool sessions (COVID allowing).

The wind and rain pelting the house woke me up at 0618.  After doing my business and recording my weight (79.3 Kg), I crawled back into bed and slept soundly through 0730.  I made banana pancakes then did the _"15 Minute Runner's Flexibility Routine"_ while breakfast settled.

Time to head to PISE.

With a left hamstring/glute getting a whole lot of attention yesterday and today, I was pretty sensitive to how this workout was going to unfold.  The warm up was a breeze on a breezy day.  No soreness to report anywhere.  I started to feel some tenderness, specifically high up on my left adductor, during the 10x100m efforts.  It was not so sore as to alter my gait;  I continued on.

Coming off a 10th stride, the first of the 5x800m efforts felt laboured.  The second and third felt more comfortable (comparatively) but the fourth 800m saw the workout catching up with me.  I messed up the recording of the workout by hitting the stop/start button as I crossed the line on the 4th 800 but the fifth effort was my most focused.

More importantly, that tender left adductor went unnoticed during the 800s but I did have a dull ache in that side's piriformis.

The Seahawks took a beating again this week.  They play again on Thursday freeing me up for the workout [next Sunday](ironman2021-40weeksout).

After the game, I headed out to the garage an sat on the TT Bike for 75 minutes.  I watched a video called _"Iron Dad"_, the story of Alex Smith and his son Harrison and their battle with Muscular Dystrophy.
