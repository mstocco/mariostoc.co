### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 40 minutes. Ideally off pavement. A few rollers would be nice.

Stretching 26 minutes: Plenty of rotation. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **43 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **7 km**

The same weather system that canceled IRONMAN Sacramento is sitting just off the coast and is bringing high winds to the Island.

Today's route was a lap of Swan Lake;  the trail was in good condition; mostly dry and the fallen leaves haven't broken down (yet).  By the time I got around the lake, the rain started.  With extra time on the clock, I did the remainder of the run in my neighbourhood.

Vasts and adductors are a bit lit up (both legs) likely from the ride [yesterday](ironman2022-45weeksout?sat).

### NOTES

I drove to the pool this morning and it was quieter that usual.  I guess a storm can do that.  I got half of the swim done in a lane all to myself until the swim club showed up at 0615 and squeezed us (the early crew) into 2 lanes.  This was a good swim with good focus on posture, position and proprioception. 

The [WIND STORM](javascript:flkty.select(2);) eased by the evening.

Run w/your buddies. Keep the effort as easy as you can. 
Around 8k in total.

Stretching 15 minutes

### NOTES
Run Time: **44 Minutes** &nbsp; Avg Pace: **5:53/km**

Tough day again at work.

Regardless, I met up with Yauki for our 3rd Tuesday Afternoon run.  We had a really nice weather window too!

He was not keen on 8 km and suggested 6 would work better for him.  Somehow I coaxed 7.5 km out of him and we walked for 10 minutes afterwards.

An interesting twinge bottom of my right lateral malleolus that went away after 5_ish_ minutes.

### NOTES
Total Time: **35 Minutes** 

Ground hog day: Solid night of sleep last night and another difficult day at work.

I got to the garage and repaired a flat on my MTB and serviced the front brake.  Then I looked at the mess that the [WIND STORM](javascript:flkty.select(2);) did to the yard and set out to clean it up.  2 hours later, I was tired hungry and ready for dinner.

Getting motivated to ride was tough but I did spin easy on the rollers while watching the latest GTN video.

The rain forecast for [yesterday](javascript:flick('wed');) started around midnight and was still pouring at 0530; I drove to the pool.

The workout in the water was **solid**.  The 50 lengths of the main set were my best and I was thankful for the 40 second rest after the 150m lengths.  Next to no people in the pool this morning; loving the free lane all to myself.
