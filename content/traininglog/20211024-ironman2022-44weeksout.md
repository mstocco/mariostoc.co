### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 40 minutes. Ideally off pavement. A few rollers would be nice.

Stretching 26 minutes: Plenty of rotation. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **43 Minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **7 km**

The same weather system that canceled IRONMAN Sacramento is sitting just off the coast and for the most part, bringing just the winds to Vancouver Island today.  I did get caught out in a downpour during the last 15 minutes of today's run.

I did a lap of Swan Lake.  The trail was in good condition; mostly dry and the fallen leaves haven't broken down (yet).  By the time I got around the lake, there was some extra time on the clock; instead of spending extra time on the trail, I did the remainder of the run in my neighbourhood. 

Vasts and adductors are a bit lit up (both legs) likely from the ride [yesterday](ironman2022-45weeksout?sat).

### NOTES
Total Time: **~40 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **1800m**

I drove to the pool this morning and it was quieter that usual.  I guess a storm can do that.  I got half of the swim done in a lane all to myself until the swim club showed up at 0615 and squeezed us (the early crew) into 2 lanes.  This was a good swim with good focus on posture, position and proprioception. 

The [storm](javascript:flkty.select(2);) eased by the evening.

Run w/ your buddies. Keep the effort as easy as you can. 
Around 8k in total.

Stretching 15 minutes

### NOTES
Run Time: **44 Minutes** &nbsp; Avg Pace: **5:53/km**

Tough day again at work.

Regardless, I met up with Yauki for our 3rd Tuesday run.  We had a really nice weather window too!

He was not keen on 8 km and suggested 6 would work better for him.  Somehow I coaxed 7.5 km out of him and we walked for 10 minutes afterwards.  An interesting twinge bottom of my right lateral malleolus that went away after 5 minutes or so.
