### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Bike: Dead bugs, glute bridges.
 
Ride 2:45-3:15 on the MTB. 
Fuel regularly, hydrate well, dress to stay warm, have fun. 
Effort is easy to steady. With harder sections as needed on 
the trail/road. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **165 Minutes**. &nbsp; Ascent: **799m**

A left glute sore enough to affect my sleep.

Today was something new; my cousin's husband and my friend, 
Chris G. accompanied me up the mountain.

We pedalled up to the north end of Thetis as Chris had never 
ridden those trails before.  The route was essentially 
_Bellamy Trail_ up to _Munn Road_.  I wanted to show Chris the 
_Kinghorn Cabin_ but the route was snowed out.
<!----->

We headed down _Munn_ to the south entrance of _Hartland_; 
then rode up _"Fun Trail"_, down _"Botton Feeder"_ and exited 
the park via _"Executive West"_.

Chris said he was happy to end the ride back at my place and 
that not ride all the way back to his home in _Oak Bay_.  I agreed 
with him.  This was a fun ride.

Interestingly, my left glute was less sore this evening.

I felt rested by the time I got out of bed.  Rhomboid is a 
bit stiff, left glute is less sore.ü§î

Busy day on the keyboard and I really didn't have the energy to jump on the bike after work.

I spun lightly on the trainer, then hit the yoga mat for a stretch, then crawled into bed.

More restful sleep.

Late leaving the house but the jog to the pool was **easy effort** and I made good time.
<!----->
I started the swim in a 50m lane and round of the drill set done before the ropes were swapped to the 25m format.

For the 12x50m efforts, got into a groove with the short rests.  Combined, I got an extra 200m of swimming and ~6 minutes of rest in between activities.

I was feeling a bit gassed to start the jog home and stayed patient until an easy rhythm was found.

Better sleep and the knot I've been fighting in my left glute max is now a knot in piriformis; been here before.

Effort was per the workout but tired legs meant the numbers were lower than [last week](challenge2023-17weeksout?wed).
