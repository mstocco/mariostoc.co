## SUNDAY OCT 04 🌤
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 90 minutes: 20 minutes easy running to warm up. 8x 200 strides @ 5k effort/pace @ 51-54 seconds per 200, 100 as 20 meters slowing to a walk, 60 meters walking, 20 meters shuffling back to a run. 3x 10 minutes @ 1/2 marathon effort/feel (lets aim for 5:08-5:15 per km) 5 minutes WALKING after each effort. 10 minutes easy jogging to cool down.

_Ideally you'll do this on the track and you'll have at least 200 calories on hand. AND enough water_.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **15 km**

I went to bed early last night but didn't have the best sleep.  I was up for a bathroom break and had a night sweats too.  When morning did come, I did have a big pancake breakfast to start the day off on a better note.

<!---->
For the 20 minute warmup, I jogged to the track at Esquimalt High.  The first effort of 200s had a target of 51 seconds.  I ran **51.4**, **50.6**, **51.9**, **50.2**, **50.9**, **50.5**, **50.9** and **50.3**; these felt smooth and comfortable.  The sun came out and it became quite warm.

After a quick sip of water, the tempo efforts of 3x10 minutes began; my target pace was 5:08/km.  The first effort was run at **5:08/km**.  I had a gel while in the recovery time before the 2nd 10 minute rep.  The next 2 reps went by quickly and I found a comfortably focused rhythm at **5:10/km** for both.

I felt **really good** with today's execution. 

While I jogged home, I got a message from Mike McD. in Calgary to let me know that while I was doing this workout, he had bested my 10K PB.

## MONDAY OCT 05 🌤
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I slept well last night and I feel like I had a solid weekend as there is residual fatigue and soreness on this foggy Monday morning.

I spent the day on the keyboard getting as much done as I could for work as I booked time off for the remainder of the week.

This Monday was a **recovery day**.

## TUESDAY OCT 06 ☀️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes easy/fun on MTB. You can substitute for another bike if you like. It'd be great if you can still ride some hills at your own pace.  
OTB: Run 30 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **130 minutes**

I woke up from an **ok sleep** and decided to start my day with the 15 minute mobility routine from a few days ago.  My day was going to be hectic so I set off before breakfast to at least get the 30 minute jog in.  

That early morning jog **sucked so much** that I needed to walk to relax my soleus' a few times.  I cut the activity short to 20 minutes.

Disappointed is the only way I could describe that run.

<!---->
At noon, Carina dropped me off at the ICBC office so I could renew my driver's licence.  Once I was done, I started to walk home when it occurred to me that if I jogged for a bit, I could save a bit of time.  What a difference a couple hours made;  I was able to jog **very comfortable** at a 5:40/km pace for the next 12 minutes.

We took the 14:20 sailing to Pender Island. 

Considering that I was still missing the scheduled ride, I put my road bike together and set of to "explore".   No worries about finding a hilly route here; there are NO FLAT ROADS on this little island.  I am feeling **a little cooked** as I write in this day's notes.  It also means [Thursday's ride](javascript:flkty.select(10);) is going to be full effort as well.

Distance: **34 km** &nbsp; Vertical: **685 m**

## WEDNESDAY OCT 07 ☀️
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 15 minutes.  
Run 75 minutes: 20 minutes easy running to warm up. 10x :30 strides, :30 WALK after each. 15 minutes easy running. 10x :30 strides, :30 walk after each. 20 minutes easy running to finish up.  
_Bring a gel or some form of calories._ 

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes**

I had a bit of a restless sleep last night; weird because I am in a bit of paridise here on Pender Island.  I enjoyed a slow, relaxing start to the day.   

Run Distance: **11.3 km** &nbsp; Ascent: **132 m** 
![Run Chart](/assets/jpg/runchart-20201005.jpeg)

<!---->
It was a climb out of Otter Bay to get to Bedwell Harbour Road, the flattest section of road that I have seen on the Island.  I took it easy and got there in about 20 minutes. This road is a main thoroughfare with no shoulder but beside it was a grass strip (probably the original roadbed) that would be my runway for the 30 second strides.  Doing the workout on that surface could have been likened to running a flat bit of XC (and no mud).

The easy portions of this run **felt easy**.  I felt some residual fatigue on the last few strides and going up the last hill before descending into Otter Bay.  My soleus' felt **better than expected** and only protested on the last long downhill.  I also enjoyed a _"coffee"_ flavoured Rekarb at the half-way point of the run.

Later in the afternoon, Carina and I walked the trail up Mt. Norman (204m).  The weather was sunny and warm at the top and it was fascinating to watch the marine layer move through the islands below.  We could hear fog-horns in the distance and every so often, we'd catch a glimpse of a ship moving through the fog; cool!

## THURSDAY OCT 08 ☁️
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **1** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:45-2:15. Island exploration. Easy riding. Bring enough calories. Have fun cruising around the island. If you run out of roads, you can cut it short.

### NOTES
Total Time: **110 minutes**

Sleep was interrupted by fog horns throughout the night but I did sleep in a bit longer than normal.

For today's ride, I was hoping to see the full distance of both islands combined.  I had [Tuesday's ride](javascript:flkty.select(6);) for a reference of the time it would take and my guess at the length of this ride was pushing 3 hours.  So I set off at a conservative pace thinking it was going to be a long afternoon.

I was wrong about both time and effort.

<!---->
I made it from Otter Bay, to Clam Bay via Port Washington then to Gowland Point, the most westerly point on South Pender Island in an hour and 14 minutes.  That surprised me but I did get a look at some of the hills that I'd have to deal with on the way home.  I started putting back some sugar and then had a great ride back.  

Overall, I am not feeling completely fresh but this was a **super fun ride** that I am really stoked with the effort.

### OTTER BAY TO GOWLAND POINT

The road riding on Pender was great and I am very thankful that Carina booked this trip.

## FRIDAY OCT 09 ☁️
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes. 
Run 60 minutes. Flattest route you can find. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

Not the best sleep on my last night on Pender.  The coffee this morning tasted good while I answered "URGENT" work emails however.  

I planned on doing the run at home where there is some flatter ground but work kept calling.  Finally I got out the down and luckily, I got this jog in before the start of the rain.  This was a run without ego; meaning I intentionally kept the pace **slow and easy**.

A few soft-tissue niggles are creeping in and will need a bit of maintenance; glute-med on the right hip at the top of the femur, right quad (lateral) and left calf (lateral).
