# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, December 6, 2020](javascript:flick('sun');)

**38 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I may be internalizing the results of [last Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) for a while.  My goal is to metaphorically, put to those thoughts in a box, put that box on a shelf, and get on with the preparation for an Ironman in 38 weeks.

## SUMMARY
I feel like was...

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes easy on the MTB. Get out and have some fun.

### NOTES

Today was a miss.  Sore throat and feeling off.  I know there is a mountain bike ride and this may be the last dry day for a while but I am really looking at curling up with a blanket and watching the Challenge Daytona race.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
25 Minute Relaxed Evening Flexibility Routine V2

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I woke up feeling groggy.

Interestingly, the sorest part of my body is my left masseter muscle.  It has been a bothering me for a week now and now chewing is very much a strained, painful experience.  If I thought that running a 23:07 5k was a punch in the jaw, then it manifests into a real thing, I'd say dumb luck.
