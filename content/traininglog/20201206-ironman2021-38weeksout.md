# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, December 6, 2020](javascript:flick('sun');)

**38 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I may be internalizing the results of the 5k time trial [last Saturday](ironman2021-39weeksout?sat) for a while.  My goal is to metaphorically, put to those thoughts in a box, put that box on a shelf, and get on with the preparation for an Ironman in less than 9 months.

## SUMMARY
I feel like was...

## SUNDAY DEC 06 üå§
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes easy on the MTB. Get out and have some fun.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Today was a miss.  Sore throat and feeling off.  I know there is a mountain bike ride and this may be the last dry day for a while but I am really looking at curling up with a blanket and watching the Challenge Daytona race.

## MONDAY DEC 07 üåß
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
25 Minute Relaxed Evening Flexibility Routine V2

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I woke up feeling groggy.

Interestingly, the sorest part of my body is my left masseter muscle.  It has been a bothering me for a week now and now chewing is very much a strained, painful experience.  If I thought that running a 23:07 5k was a punch in the jaw, then it manifests into a real thing, I'd say dumb luck.

## TUESDAY DEC 08 üåß
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Trainer 70 minutes: 25 minutes easy spinning to warm up. 10x 1:00 high cadence/very stable hips, 1:30 easy after each. 20 minutes easy spinning to finish up. 
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 minutes**

So so sleep last night.

I use the rollers instead of setting up the trainer.  I am pretty confident that the rollers force my hips to be steady during that cadence work otherwise I would be picking myself up off the floor (or worse).  I loaded the workout into my bike computer and just pedalled by the beeps (meaning there was no looking at numbers).  I felt **pretty good** about the effort and was generally around 120RPM for the 10x1:00 spins.

New Product: I mixed 52 grams of _Country Time Lemonade_ and a pinch of salt into a 600ml bottle and stopped briefly to drink throughout the bike workout; I finished it all before the 70 minutes too.  The lemonade crystals are a _"first time try"_ for me as my last tub of _Gatorade_ is almost done.  No GI, ok taste and vitamin C.

The shoes and headlamp were with me in the garage and once the bike was put away, I headed out for the run (almost) off the bike.  I could still feel **some residual fatigue** from the run [last Saturday](ironman2021-39weeksout?sat); specifically in the left hamstring/glute but my right achilles was stiff too.  Tonight's run was a super chill effort around the neighbourhood and I was lucky to have a period of no rain to enjoy the Christmas lights that people have strung up for the season.

## WEDNESDAY DEC 09 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes (Really slow moving one)   
Run 50 minutes. Rolling to hilly route. Effort is EASY. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **53 minutes**

I didn't feel like I slept all that well as I woke from a dream or a nightmare; I honestly can't remember.  My jaw works today (finally).

Work has been busy and engaging of late.  I have a handle on some of work's support tasks (which can be a drag) and I am back to doing more development coding.

I ran after dark again tonight; if there isn't pace work on the schedule, I do find it **very relaxing**.  The low light gives me the illusion that I am running faster than I am but my heart rate stays in a perfect zone two range.
<!---->
I also didn't run with much of a route in mind other than going over _Craigflower Hill_ (between _Tillicum_ and _Admirals_).  Once I got to _Admirals Road_, I decided that the hilliest route back would be to simply turn around and retrace the route I just did.  Effort was **easy** and everything felt good too.

I did the mobility after dinner.  This routine was different in that there was no background music.  First movement(s) showed me that there isn't much internal rotation in my shoulders and the last movement let me know that my left glute/hamstring is **pretty stiff** and tender.

## THURSDAY DEC 10 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 25 minutes.   
Trainer 70 minutes: 20 minutes easy riding to warm up. 8x :45 high cadence, :30 easy after each. 3:00 easy. 12x :15 seated/strong effort (something you could hold for 3-5 minutes up a really steep hill, NOT a sprint) :45 easy spin after each. 5 minutes easy riding. 5x 1:00 high cadence, 1:00 easy riding. 10 minutes easy to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 minutes**

Another so-so sleep last night.  I am feeling tight in the hip flexors even though they were part of yesterday's mobility routine.

Today was another engaged day at work.  There is a push to get a quantity of work complete before we go into a company _"brown-out"_, a period of no systems changes over the holiday season.
<!---->
After dinner, I headed out to the garage for the workout on the rollers.  I felt a bit of the ride from [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');) lingering in the legs.  Regardless I pedalled through and got +70 minutes on the bike.  I didn't program the last part of the workout correctly.
