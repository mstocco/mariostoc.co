# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, April 2, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**12** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Ride my bikes (plural), protect my injured foot and stretch.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **11.75 Hours**

I feel like I was **LIMPING LESS**

By the end of this week, I am in the boot less but still being cautious with my right foot.  The swelling has mostly receded but the local discolouration is still visible.

First week to take my current TT bike off the trainer and put it on the road; Velofix still has the new one but I think it is close to being done.

The weather still feels cooler than normal.

### NOTES
Time: **120 Mins** &nbsp;Trainer: **129W** &nbsp;Swim: **2600m**

I rode the trainer first (time management).  I felt better 
than I thought I would.  I dropped the nose of my saddle down 
to relieve some of the pressure the I was feeling lately.
<!---->
I watched a GCN short film that followed a 28 year old 
American in his quest to secure a pro-cycling contract by 
racing in Belgium.  Getting lost in a well presented cycling 
story while turning my legs over was fun.

---

In the pool however, I was feeling the effort of the ride. 
_Mercury Rising_ had a group workout in the lane beside me. 
That perked me up and gave me some peers to compare against.
Their workout ended; 10 minutes later, the coach jumped 
in the lane and demolished whatever ego I had built swimming 
alongside her athletes.

25 strong finish to stroke may be a HUGE basket of fruit to 
pick.  Noticed it approaching the wall and reviewing the 
activity now that I am home...

I jumped on the trainer, loaded the IM Copenhagen course into Fulgaz (because its flat) and then checked out the first part of that route from the lagoon, out of the city and up the coast.  Video was recorded in the early spring and with the weather and road conditions, it looked a lot like a flatter version of Victoria.

No fan and I just let the sweat pour.

Swam _SCM_ this afternoon as work had me longer than planned.  I completed the workout but NOT the cooldown; I needed to pee.  I didn't feel like limping back to the pool deck for the last 200m; I hit the showers.

Guy in the lane beside me asked, "How is it that I can breath every fourth stroke?"  I didn't have a good answer for him because I never thought about it before.

### NOTES

Most of the discolouration in my foot is gone apart from a distinct dark bruise on the lateral side of the cuboid.

I watched the movie _Moneyball_ while sitting on the trainer afterwork.  I had the fan going today and things felt easier.

No pain in my foot but the exercise did move the blood around; the discolouration is visible beyond the cuboid area.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

Ride 90 minutes. On the MTB or road bike. 
At this point, I'm hoping you'll be good to ride a few rollers. 
Water front, or Goose seem like good options. 
Effort is EASY. But getting out for a solid weekday ride. 

Mobility 18 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** 

First ride outside on the TT bike this season.  I picked a windy day to remind myself of what an aero wheel feels like to do it too.  Pretty interesting to feel the contrast of same bike, same setup inside versus outside too.

I left the bike in the house hoping (weather permitting) that I can take this bike for a spin again [tomorrow](javascript:flick('sat');).

### NOTES
Moving Time: **180 Minutes**

Another day with the TT bike outside.  Today however, I wearing tights and an undershirt in addition to my Santini jacket.

I effort was super easy and I headed north up the Lochside route.  The weather blowing in from _Haro Strait_ was telling and I heading inland to _Elk Lake_.  It got wetter from there, or at least until _Interurban Road_.

I was under 90 minutes until I was back in my neighbourhood, so I headed west on the _Goose_ up to _Langford_.

I swung back to _Colwood_ on my was to _Esquimalt_ when the rain started again.  Wet and starting to get cold, I headed home and put the bike on the trainer for the balance of the scheduled 3 hours.

I would get into the aerobars from time to time but the majority of the time outside, I was sitting up.
