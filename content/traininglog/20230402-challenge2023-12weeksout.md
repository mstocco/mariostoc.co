### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2600: 
10x 100 aerobic/smooth. Odds: Swim, Evens: w/ buoy. R :20 after each. 
6x 50 as 25 fist drill/25 strong finish to stroke. R :20 after each. 
6x 200 aerobic/smooth w/ 2x sighting per 50. Not a ton of sighting.

2x 50 super easy to cool down.

Ride 60 minutes EASY. On the trainer. 
Spinning the legs.

### NOTES
Time: **120 Mins** &nbsp;Trainer: **129W** &nbsp;Swim: **2600m**

I rode the trainer first (time management).  I felt better 
than I thought I would.  I dropped the nose of my saddle down 
to relieve some of the pressure the I was feeling lately.
<!---->
I watched a GCN short film that followed a 28 year old 
American in his quest to secure a pro-cycling contract by 
racing in Belgium.  Getting lost in a well presented cycling 
story while turning my legs over was fun.

---

In the pool however, I was feeling the effort of the ride. 
_Mercury Rising_ had a group workout in the lane beside me. 
That perked me up and gave me some peers to compare against.
Their workout ended; 10 minutes later, the coach jumped 
in the lane and demolished whatever ego I had built swimming 
alongside her athletes.

25 strong finish to stroke may be a HUGE basket of fruit to 
pick.  Noticed it approaching the wall and reviewing the 
activity now that I am home...

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

Either inside or on the road bike on the Lochside  
(aka: Flat and low stress)

Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Mins** &nbsp; Trainer: **127W NP**
 
I jumped on the trainer, loaded the IM Copenhagen course into Fulgaz (because its flat) and then checked out the first part of that route from the lagoon, out of the city and up the coast.  Video was recorded in the early spring and with the weather and road conditions, it looked a lot like a flatter version of Victoria.

No fan and I just let the sweat pour.

### NOTES

Swam _SCM_ this afternoon as work had me longer than planned; completed the workout but NOT the cooldown as I needed to pee.  After getting to the changeroom, I didn't feel like limping back to the pool deck for the last 200m; I hit the showers.

Guy in the lane beside me asked, "How is it that I can breath every fourth stroke?"  I didn't have a good answer for him because I never thought about it before.
