This will be the first time back in the pool for me since March.

### NOTES
Total Moving Time: **135 minutes**  
Distance: **58 km**

Posterior from the lumbar to my calves feels worked over (in a good way) but my left glute and hamstring is tender.

For the ride, I figured a loop out to YYJ gets me the time and route profile needed for today.  There was a light breeze from the north, it was sunny and I felt **really good** all ride long.  I took a bit of time at Patricia Bay before heading south.  I also had a tube decided to stop holding air on the way back that broke up the flow of my ride.

Seahawks thumped the 49ers too; **great day**.

I was up earlier than expected but I was able to get an extra hour of before the start of the day.

I had a productive day at work too. 

I did have more than a passing sad moment, thinking about my dad.       

All in a typical Monday.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers 60 minutes: 30 minutes easy to start. 4 rounds (:10, :20, :30, :40, :50 high cadence on 1:00) 10 minutes easy to finish up.   
Run 30 minutes easy and flat.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I looked at the weather and decided to do the easy run first while I had a tiny bit of daylight and pocket of no rain.  As far as the trend of Tuesday run's sucking, this **sucked less** than last week but had the same common aches in my soleus'/ankles.  I was not in a rush and did finish the last 5 minutes feeling ok.

I had a small pasta dinner and a 45 period of digestion before heading out to the garage for a session on the rollers.  The cadence work was **fun**; the live stream of the US Presidential Election was unexpected.
