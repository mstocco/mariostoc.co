# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, November 1, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(3);)

**43 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
The scheduled volume is lower for this first week of November.  After the workout [yesterday](ironman2021-44weeksout), I will be focusing on **remaining consistent** and **recovery**.

This will be the first time [back in the pool](javascript:flkty.select(11);) for me since March.

## SUMMARY
I feel like was **STAYING CONSISTENT**.

The programming this week was a _little shorter_ and I finished with about **8 hours** of training time.  Even so, I had some good efforts this week, in particular I felt **noticeably stronger** during the ride on [Sunday](javascript:flkty.select(3);) and had a **solid hill workout** at _Mt. Tolmie_ on [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(6);).

Outside of training, life continues.  I still experience moments of missing my dad which I except as _perfectly normal, perfectly healthy_.

Posterior from the lumbar to my calves feels worked over (in a good way) but my left glute and hamstring is tender.

For the ride, I figured a loop out to YYJ gets me the time and route profile needed for today.  There was a light breeze from the north, it was sunny and I felt **really good** all ride long.  I took a bit of time at _Patricia Bay_ before heading south.  I also had a tube decided to stop holding air on the way back that broke up the flow of my ride.

Seahawks thumped the 49ers too; **great day**!

25 minutes of mobility.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I was up earlier than expected but I was able to get an extra hour of before the start of the day.

I had a productive day at work too. 

I did have more than a passing sad moment, thinking about my dad.       

All in a typical Monday.

## TUESDAY NOV 03 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers 60 minutes: 30 minutes easy to start. 4 rounds (:10, :20, :30, :40, :50 high cadence on 1:00) 10 minutes easy to finish up.   
Run 30 minutes easy and flat.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I looked at the weather and decided to do the easy run first while I had a tiny bit of daylight and a pocket of no rain.  As far as the trend of Tuesday run's sucking, this **sucked less** than last week but had the same common aches in my soleus'/ankles.  I was not in a rush and did finish the last 5 minutes feeling ok.

I had a small pasta dinner and a 45 minute period of digestion before heading out to the garage for a session on the rollers.  The cadence work on the bike was **fun**; the live stream of the US Presidential Election was unexpected.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 24 minutes.  
Run 70 minutes. Hilly route. Easy effort

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes** &nbsp; Elevation: **420 m**

Another night where I wish I could have slept just a bit longer.   Glutes were a bit sore this morning too (in a _good_ way); it's a positive sign whenever that group shows activation IMHO.

_Mount Tolmie_ was integrated into today's plan for a hilly route.  I thought I had a weather window but that collapsed rather quickly; I jogged the trails of the park under rain showers, heavy at times.  Although I was soaked, the temperature was around 13¬∞C so  I was comfortable.  In fact, I felt **pretty good** and worked through moments when the hills added a challenge.

I finished with a **solid runner's high**.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 17 minutes.   
Rollers ~ 60 minutes. Easy riding.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

I was awake at 0350 and stayed in bed until 0700; frustrating but what can you do?

Thanks to [yesterday](javascript:flkty.select(6);), my posterior, specifically both glute meds, have been sore all day.

After dinner, I jumped on the TT bike a rode the rollers; steady and easy effort for an hour.  I took a much-needed break from the American new cycle and watched the 2020 UCI Elite Women's XC Championship that was held in Austria; pretty cool race.

Odd creaking noise developed (in the frame perhaps?).  I will need to look at this at some point.

## FRIDAY NOV 06 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 30 minutes easy to start. 10x :25 strides, :35 WALK after each. 5 minute jog to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 minutes**

Awake earlier that I would have liked but I felt somewhat refreshed this morning.  Last night's ride helped with any soreness.

This evening's run started slow with a funky soreness in my left foot; not the navicular but in the area.  About a minute in, I pressed pause on the watch and walked for a bit.  Once I was confident that I was going to complete the full 60 minutes, I restarted the recording and got on with my old age aches.  I kept things slow (real slow) and as has been typical of late, things warm up after 20ish minutes.

Along with any aches, my legs felt heavy too.
<!---->
I did the strides closer to home on _Crease Ave_ because the road is pretty flat and unlike the bike paths, free of fallen leaves.  Running fast is fun and I kept things to **no more than 90%**.  The first rep was slow (4:28/km) then each one after that became easier and faster (average 4:03/km).

I miss read the workout and jogged a 10 minute cool down instead of the allotted 5;  unlike the start of the run, I felt **comfortable** and could have gone forever at the easy pace.

The run wrapped up after sunset and on a clear night, the season has definitely changed; the temperatures are now noticeably cooler.
