## TUESDAY MAR 28 ‚òÄÔ∏è
  
<br />Met with Dr. P.J. Dryden at the _VGH Orthopaedic Clinic_ 
this morning.

His diagnosis is an avulsion fracture to my cuboid. 
Effectively, when I rolled my ankle a tendon attached to the 
cuboid pulled hard enough to crack the bone.  The fracture is 
non-displaced and the cuboid is right where it is supposed to 
be.  It was emphasized that this is not a "nutcracker" type of 
break.

I am to continue with the walking boot until the swelling 
recedes; crutches are not needed.  Treatment is similar to a 
sprained foot and I am cleared for swimming and biking but...   

**NO RUNNING for the next month**.

Voice in the back of my head said to skip the pool today.  Looked at the swim volume next week and that anxious voice was squashed.

Swam very gingerly, got the workout done with a better headspace to swim again on [Sunday](challenge2023-12weeksout?sun)
