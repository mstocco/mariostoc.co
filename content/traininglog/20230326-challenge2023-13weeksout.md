## TUESDAY MAR 28 ‚òÄÔ∏è
  
<br />Met with Dr. P.J. Dryden at the _VGH Orthopaedic Clinic_ 
this morning.

His diagnosis is an avulsion fracture to my cuboid. 
Effectively, when I rolled my ankle a tendon attached to the 
cuboid pulled hard enough to crack the bone.  The fracture is 
non-displaced and the cuboid is right where it is supposed to 
be.  It was emphasized that this is not a "nutcracker" type of 
break.

I am to continue with the walking boot until the swelling 
recedes; crutches are not needed.  Treatment is similar to a 
sprained foot and I am cleared for swimming and biking but...   

**NO RUNNING for the next month**.

## THURSDAY MAR 30 üå§
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **5**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes easy. Ideally on the trainer. No risk of crashing. And no need to take your foot out of your pedal on short notice. 
This probably won't be necessary in a few more days, but good to be patient for the time being.

### NOTES
Time: **60 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **99W**

Got on to the bike first, then put on my shoes.  I pedalled with a bit of trainer assisted for the first bit before zeroing out the grade for the last half.  Tried standing very briefly; not there yet.

Voice in the back of my head said to skip the pool today.  Looked at the swim volume next week and that anxious voice was squashed.

Swam very gingerly, got the workout done with a better headspace to swim again on [Sunday](challenge2023-12weeksout?sun)

## SATURDAY APR 1 üå¶
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:00 EASY on the Trainer. 
Matt isn't announcing this race. Sounds like you're in for some Dede time. 

Mobility 30 minutes.

### NOTES
Time: **130 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **100W**

Foot is noticeably less swollen today.

I got on the bike and 40 minutes into the ride, Carina called.  She was stranded as our car wouldn't start.  I rode the balance of the time (plus 10 mins) when we got everything sorted and back home.  Free-ride set on a simulated level gradient (no trainer assist today).  Watched _"Pulp Fiction"_ to pass the time.  Saddle pressure was the discomfort.
