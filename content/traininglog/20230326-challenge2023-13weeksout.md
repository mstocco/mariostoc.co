### NOTES
Met with Dr P.J. Dryden at the VGH Orthopaedic Clinic this morning.

His diagnosis is an avulsion fracture to my cuboid.  Effectively, when I rolled my ankle a tendon attached to the cuboid pulled hard enough to crack the bone.  The fracture is non-displaced and the cuboid is right where it is supposed to be.  It was emphasized that this is not a "nutcracker" type of break.

I am to continue with the walking boot until the swelling recedes; crutches are not needed.  Treatment is similar to a sprained foot and I am cleared for swimming and biking but NO RUNNING for the next month.
