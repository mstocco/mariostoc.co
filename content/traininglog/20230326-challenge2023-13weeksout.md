# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, March 26, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**13** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Continue rest and recovery.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **4 Hours** <small>(happy)</small>

I feel like I was **REBOOTING**

I spent almost all of my time in the walking boot at the 
beginning of the week, and less by the end.  Met with a 
surgeon to go over the fracture on [Tuesday](javascript:flkty.select(3);), 
threw a leg over the trainer on [Thursday](javascript:flick('thu');) and 
was in the pool on [Friday](javascript:flick('fri');).

Not bad, I was expecting things to be worse.

---

Maybe one of the more frustrating things to this week is looking 
out the window and seeing a nice week of weather going to waste.

## TUESDAY MAR 28 ‚òÄÔ∏è
  
<br />Met with Dr. P.J. Dryden at the _VGH Orthopaedic Clinic_ 
this morning.

His diagnosis is an avulsion fracture to my cuboid. 
Effectively, when I rolled my ankle a tendon attached to the 
cuboid pulled hard enough to crack the bone.  The fracture is 
non-displaced and the cuboid is right where it is supposed to 
be.  It was emphasized that this is not a "nutcracker" type of 
break.

I am to continue with the walking boot until the swelling 
recedes; crutches are not needed.  Treatment is similar to a 
sprained foot and I am cleared for swimming and biking but...   

**NO RUNNING for the next month**.

Got on to the bike first, then slipped into my shoes. I 
pedalled with a bit of trainer assisted (-1% grade) at 
first before zeroing out the grade to finish up.

Tried standing very briefly; not there yet.

Voice in the back of my head said to skip the pool today. 
Looked at the swim volume next week and that anxious voice was 
squashed.

Barely kicking makes me more aware of how low my legs have 
sunk in the water.
Swam very gingerly, got the workout done with a better headspace 
to swim again on [Sunday](challenge2023-12weeksout?sun).

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:00 EASY on the Trainer. 
Matt isn't announcing this race. Sounds like you're in for 
some Dede time. 

Mobility 30 minutes.

### NOTES
Time: **130 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **120W**

Foot is noticeably less swollen today.

I got on the bike and 40 minutes into the ride, Carina called. 
She was stranded as our car wouldn't start.  I rode the balance 
of the time (plus 10 mins) when we got everything sorted and 
back home.

Free-ride set on a simulated level gradient (no trainer assist today).

Watched _"Pulp Fiction"_ to pass the time.  Saddle pressure 
was the only discomfort.
