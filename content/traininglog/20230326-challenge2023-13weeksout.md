## TUESDAY MAR 28 ‚òÄÔ∏è
  
<br />Met with Dr. P.J. Dryden at the _VGH Orthopaedic Clinic_ 
this morning.

His diagnosis is an avulsion fracture to my cuboid. 
Effectively, when I rolled my ankle a tendon attached to the 
cuboid pulled hard enough to crack the bone.  The fracture is 
non-displaced and the cuboid is right where it is supposed to 
be.  It was emphasized that this is not a "nutcracker" type of 
break.

I am to continue with the walking boot until the swelling 
recedes; crutches are not needed.  Treatment is similar to a 
sprained foot and I am cleared for swimming and biking but...   

**NO RUNNING for the next month**.
