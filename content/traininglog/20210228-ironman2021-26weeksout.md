## SUNDAY FEB 28 ☁️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
A long walk.

### NOTES
Total Walk Time: **118 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **11 km**

I was stiff when I first woke up but once I was up and about, my back felt as good as it has been in what feels like forever.  The test of putting on a pair of socks confirmed as much but I am not 100% yet; call it 75%.

During the walk, I started to feel the fatigue in my QL become noticeable at the one hour mark.  Nothing acute but enough to remind me to continue with good posture.

I rested and worked with both a lacrosse and golf ball to finish up the day.

I am frustrated that at 6 months in and 6 months to go, my reality has been reduced to a walk.
