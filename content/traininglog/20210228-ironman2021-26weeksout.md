# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, February 28, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**26 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
My goal is to discover some patience with myself as my back continues to mend.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like had **TURNED THE CORNER**

Walking and swimming.  I typically would not count walking as training but if that is all I should/could do, then this was an ok week; it certainly could have been worse.

Work stress is still high and maybe that is why this QL spasm has taken longer to bounce back.

Outside of training and work, I must say, I like that sunrises are getting earlier.  We also had nicer weather this week too.

## SUNDAY FEB 28 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
A long walk.

### NOTES
Total Walk Time: **118 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **11 km**

I was stiff when I first woke up but once I was up and about, my back felt as good as it has been in what feels like forever.  The test of putting on a pair of socks confirmed as much but I am not 100% yet; call it 75%.

During the walk, I started to feel the fatigue in my QL become noticeable at the one hour mark.  Nothing acute but enough to remind me to continue with good posture.

I rested and worked with both a lacrosse and golf ball to finish up the day.

I am frustrated that at 6 months in and 6 months to go, my reality has been reduced to a walk.

## MONDAY MAR 01 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
am: Walk 20-30 minutes.  
5:30pm. Swim. Same deal. Easy 50's. With and without the buoy. If that goes well, progress to moderate effort and up to 100 continuous

### NOTES
Total Time: **40 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **1850m**

This morning's sock test was a bit better; I hit the end range of motion in my back about an inch before getting the sock lined up with my big toe (no wall, chair, support used).  New muscle soreness, apart from my QL, is the top of my left quad; is lit up and feeling almost bruised.

My swim workout consisted of 50 and 100m efforts, with/without a pull buoy.  Easy to steady effort **felt good**.  I had a lane to myself for most of the time.  Although I could have gone to 2000 (maybe more) I decided not to press my luck.  I felt like my time **was productive**.

## TUESDAY MAR 02 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
AM/Noon: Walk 30 minutes.   
Noon/PM: Walk 45 minutes.

*BONUS Swim!

### NOTES
Total Time: **49 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **2100m**

It is **difficult** to see how slow the progress has been with my back; this is not typical and previous flare ups generally have not taken this long.  Regardless of my frustration, there has been small improvements every day and today there is another, noticeable but small improvement.  The soreness where the QL attaches to the ribs has calmed right down and I am left with some tenderness surrounding the L5 joint and tightness throughout the hip/glute area.

Putting on my socks this morning reminded me that I am not out of the woods with this issue yet.
<!---->
I was able to find an open spot at Esquimalt today and although I swam [yesterday](javascript:flick('mon');), the upcoming weeks are looking spotty for lane availability (both at Crystal Pool and Esquimalt).  With yesterday's simple swim still in my head, I took that same workout and tacked on a little more at the beginning and the end.  I feel like this was another **productive session** with good focus on posture and form.

Compared to yesterday, today was 5 minutes longer in the water.  Both session included a 200m effort at the end.  Yesterday, I comfortably swam that in _3:54.3_ and today, that 200m was _4:02.7_.  Numbers aside, I am thankful that I swam.

## WEDNESDAY MAR 03 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Noon: PT appointment.   
Whenever: Walk 90 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Walking Time: **+110 minutes**

Each day, I am slowly returning to my good self.  When the socks went on this morning, I hit the end of range in my L5 joint without the an accompanying jolt of pain.  Overall, I am scoring this injury as 90% back to health.  Maybe by the weekend I will be doing more that walk or swim.
 
This afternoon, I had an epiphany moment when I was working with Michelle from The Athlete Centre; more movement pattern discovery and core engagement work.  I was surprised to be able to bend over and touch my toes.  I am looking forward to getting back at training sooner than later.
<!---->
Walking included to and from PT (3km) and a trip up and around [Christmas Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);).

### WALK AROUND THE HILL

During the walk after work, I felt great but after dinner, my QL was tired and a bit sore.

## THURSDAY MAR 04 üå§
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
AM/Noon: Walk 45 minutes.  
Noon/PM: Walk 45- 60 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Interestingly, my QL is sore this morning but not in an acute way; this feels like normal muscle soreness (I did effectively walk a bunch of stairs on the trail yesterday).  I am thinking this is another small win toward getting back at it.

## FRIDAY MAR 05 üå¶
Sleep **5** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **2**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim.  Repeat 50s with and without a pull bouy

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 minutes**

I was awake more than a few times throughout the night; mostly in anticipation of the 0500 alarm that I had set.  The only open lane that I could book was Crystal Pool for 0530.

Although today's morning was way early (for me), once in the water, I felt great.  I swam in the _"Continuous Lane"_ and there was not much congestion.  2 lengths without a bouy, 2 lengths with a bouy with at least 10 seconds rest between lengths.  I'd stretch the rest a bit longer if I needed spacing with others in the pool.

In all honesty, getting up at _"oh-dark-hundred"_ to get a swim in felt like a really good way to start the day.
<!---->
I originally thought about swimming 2100m but as the workout progressed, my times increased; what started as low 50 seconds for a length, slowly crept up to just over a minute.  I decided to call it a workout at the 1900m mark.  No sense swimming with degraded form just to get 200 more metres.

---

In other news, **my back feels fantastic!**  
Zero difficulty using _"the sock test"_ before and after the swim.  Good times are coming.

## SATURDAY MAR 06 üå¶
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run/walk: 60 Minutes.   10 minutes walking, 8x4min jog with 1 minutes recovery.  10 minutes of walking to finish.  Focus on breath work.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I felt asleep and stayed asleep last night; nice!  My lower back is again, pain free and my range of motion is getting close to my normal; nice!

The walk/jog was generally ok.  No back pain.  My focus was on a new (for me) diaphragmatic breathing technique.  I suck at it; it is not natural but I didn't quit on the idea.
