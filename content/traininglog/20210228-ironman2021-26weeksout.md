## SUNDAY FEB 28 ☁️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
A long walk.

### NOTES
Total Walk Time: **118 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **11 km**

I was stiff when I first woke up but once I was up and about, my back felt as good as it has been in what feels like forever.  The test of putting on a pair of socks confirmed as much but I am not 100% yet; call it 75%.

During the walk, I started to feel the fatigue in my QL become noticeable at the one hour mark.  Nothing acute but enough to remind me to continue with good posture.

I rested and worked with both a lacrosse and golf ball to finish up the day.

I am frustrated that at 6 months in and 6 months to go, my reality has been reduced to a walk.

The score of this morning's sock test was a bit better; I hit the end range of motion in my back about an inch before getting the sock lined up with my big toe and no other support (wall, chair, etc) used.  What is interesting is the muscle soreness in other areas related to this QL.  This morning it happens to be the top of my left quad that is lit up and feeling almost bruised.
