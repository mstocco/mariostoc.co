## SUNDAY FEB 28 ☁️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
A long walk.

### NOTES
Total Walk Time: **118 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **11 km**

I was stiff when I first woke up but once I was up and about, my back felt as good as it has been in what feels like forever.  The test of putting on a pair of socks confirmed as much but I am not 100% yet; call it 75%.

During the walk, I started to feel the fatigue in my QL become noticeable at the one hour mark.  Nothing acute but enough to remind me to continue with good posture.

I rested and worked with both a lacrosse and golf ball to finish up the day.

I am frustrated that at 6 months in and 6 months to go, my reality has been reduced to a walk.

## MONDAY MAR 01 ⛅️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
am: Walk 20-30 minutes.  
5:30pm. Swim. Same deal. Easy 50's. With and without the buoy. If that goes well, progress to moderate effort and up to 100 continuous

### NOTES
Total Time: **40 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **1850m**

This morning's sock test was a bit better; I hit the end range of motion in my back about an inch before getting the sock lined up with my big toe (no wall, chair, support used).  New muscle soreness, apart from my QL, is the top of my left quad; is lit up and feeling almost bruised.

My swim workout consisted of 50 and 100m efforts, with/without a pull buoy.  Easy to steady effort **felt good**.  I had a lane to myself for most of the time.  Although I could have gone to 2000 (maybe more) I decided not to press my luck.  I felt like my time **was productive**.

## TUESDAY MAR 02 ⛅️
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
AM/Noon: Walk 30 minutes.   
Noon/PM: Walk 45 minutes.

*BONUS Swim!

### NOTES
Total Time: **49 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **2100m**

It is **difficult** to see how slow the progress has been with my back; this is not typical and previous flare ups generally have not taken this long.  Regardless of my frustration, there has been small improvements every day and today there is another, noticeable but small improvement.  The soreness where the QL attaches to the ribs has calmed right down and I am left with some tenderness surrounding the L5 joint and tightness throughout the hip/glute area.

Putting on my socks this morning reminded me that I am not out of the woods with this issue yet.

I was able to find an open spot at Esquimalt today and although I swam [yesterday](javascript:flick('mon');), the upcoming weeks are looking spotty for lane availability (both at Crystal Pool and Esquimalt).  With yesterday's simple swim still in my head, I took that same workout and tacked on a little more at the beginning and the end.  I feel like this was another **productive session** with good focus on posture and form.

Compared to yesterday, today was 5 minutes longer in the water.  Both session included a 200m effort at the end.  Yesterday, I comfortably swam that in _3:54.3_ and today, that 200m was _4:02.7_.  Numbers aside, I am thankful that I swam.

## WEDNESDAY MAR 03 ☁️
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Noon: PT appointment.   
Whenever: Walk 90 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Walking Time: **+110 minutes**

Each day, I am slowly returning to my good self.  When the socks went on this morning, I hit the end of range in my L5 joint without the an accompanying jolt of pain.  Overall, I am scoring this injury as 90% back to health.  Maybe by the weekend I will be doing more that walk or swim.
 
This afternoon, I had an epiphany moment when I was working with Michelle from The Athlete Centre; more movement pattern discovery and core engagement work.  I was surprised to be able to bend over and touch my toes.  I am looking forward to getting back at training sooner than later.

Walking included to and from PT (3km) and a trip up and around [Christmas Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);).  During the walk after work, I felt fine but after dinner, I could tell that the QL was tired.
