## SUNDAY FEB 28 ☁️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
A long walk.

### NOTES
Total Walk Time: **118 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **11 km**

I was stiff when I first woke up but once I was up and about, my back felt as good as it has been in what feels like forever.  The test of putting on a pair of socks confirmed as much but I am not 100% yet; call it 75%.

During the walk, I started to feel the fatigue in my QL become noticeable at the one hour mark.  Nothing acute but enough to remind me to continue with good posture.

I rested and worked with both a lacrosse and golf ball to finish up the day.

I am frustrated that at 6 months in and 6 months to go, my reality has been reduced to a walk.

## MONDAY MAR 01 ⛅️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
am: Walk 20-30 minutes.  
5:30pm. Swim. Same deal. Easy 50's. With and without the buoy. If that goes well, progress to moderate effort and up to 100 continuous at a time

### NOTES
Total Time: **40 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **1850m**

This morning's sock test was a bit better; I hit the end range of motion in my back about an inch before getting the sock lined up with my big toe (no wall, chair, support used).  New muscle soreness, apart from my QL, is the top of my left quad; is lit up and feeling almost bruised.

I did plug in a swim workout into my watch, consisting of 50 and 100m efforts, with and without a pull buoy.  Swimming at easy to steady effort felt good.  I had the lane to myself for most of the time in the pool.  I swam to 1850m and although I could have gone to 2000 (maybe more) I decided not to press my luck.  I felt like my time was productive.

## TUESDAY MAR 02
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
AM/Noon: Walk 30 minutes.   
Noon/PM: Walk 45 minutes.  
*BONUS Swim!

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

It is **difficult** to see how slow the progress has been with my back; this is not typical and previous flare ups generally have not taken this long.  Regardless of my frustration, there has been small improvements every day and today there is another, noticeable but small improvement.  The soreness where the QL attaches to the ribs has calmed right down and I am left with some tenderness surrounding the L5 joint and tightness throughout the hip/glute area.  Putting on my socks this morning reminded me that I am not out of the woods with this issue yet.
