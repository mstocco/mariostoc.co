# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 3, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**34 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
If [last week](ironman2021-35weeksout) showed me anything, it is that I really need to do a better job of recognizing and paying heed to the different stressors that may come up.  It is time to start putting more raw veggies on the plate too.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

I had a good sleep last night and woke feeling refreshed.

The Seahawks were up 6 - 3 over the 49ers midway through the 2nd quarter when I headed out the door for the run.  I thought I'd change up the route and make my way to the _Maplewood/Blenkinsop Road_ area and then figure out a way to incorporate [Christmas Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);).

It didn't take too long to figure out that there wasn't much juice in the legs this afternoon which encouraged me to settle into a conservative pace early.

Around the 42 minute mark, I had a really nice surprise.  My cousin Tania and her husband David noticed me jogging on _Cedar Hill X-Road_.  I stopped my watch and we had a wonderful twenty minute visit.      

Getting going again meant another warm up and reinforced that conservative pace that I was chugging along with during the fist part of this workout.  I made it to the base of Christmas Hill but after leaving the road, the trail was muddy and wet.  I walked most of the trail to the top.  Once at the top, I stopped to snap a picture for this week before walking down the west side of the hill until I was back on a dry trail.

Regardless of stopping twice on today run, the last 10 minutes felt more like the end of a 2 hour run versus the 80th minute.

### NOTES
Total Time: **110 minutes**

Sleep was ok last night.  I slept in too but in moving around this morning, I am feeling the [yesterday's run](javascript:flick('sun');) (stiff).

With intermittent showers in the vicinity, I picked the road bike and did a counterclockwise loop of the waterfront with a short run west to start.
<!---->
Not much to write about as I felt pretty good for the most part.  I had a gel at an hour and ten minutes in (Salted Watermelon Gu).  Near the _UVic Campus_, the rain began so I made a beeline for home on _McKenzie Avenue_.  That put me in back to where I pressed start with 9 minutes still on the clock.  I could have done a bit (a lot) more but I called it a ride.

I spend some time with the foam roller before dinner and was surprised at how sore my hamstrings (both) were.
