# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 3, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**34 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
If [last week](ironman2021-35weeksout) showed me anything, it is that I really need to do a better job of recognizing and paying heed to the different stressors that may come up.  It is time to start putting more raw veggies on the plate too.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **GETTING IT DONE**.

With extra time off work, I was able to get:

* my first **13.5 hour training week** of 2021,
* hit really nice weather for outdoor workouts,
* saw the first small drop in weight and
* got more sleep.

I had a good sleep last night and woke feeling refreshed.

The Seahawks were up 6 - 3 over the 49ers midway through the 2nd quarter when I headed out the door for the run.  I thought I'd change up the route and make my way to the _Maplewood/Blenkinsop Road_ area and then figure out a way to incorporate [Christmas Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);).

It didn't take too long to figure out that there wasn't much juice in the legs this afternoon which encouraged me to settle into a conservative pace early. 
<!---->
Around the 42 minute mark, I had a really nice surprise.  My cousin Tania and her husband David noticed me jogging on _Cedar Hill X-Road_.  I stopped my watch and we had a wonderful twenty minute visit.      

Getting going again meant another warm up and reinforced that conservative pace that I was chugging along with during the fist part of this workout.  I made it to the base of Christmas Hill but after leaving the road, the trail was muddy and wet.  I walked most of the trail to the top.  Once at the top, I stopped to snap a picture for this week before walking down the west side of the hill until I was back on a dry trail.

Regardless of stopping twice on today run, the last 10 minutes felt more like the end of a 2 hour run versus the 80th minute.

### NOTES

Sleep was ok last night.  I slept in too but in moving around this morning, I am feeling the [yesterday's run](javascript:flick('sun');) (stiff).

With intermittent showers in the vicinity, I picked the road bike and did a counterclockwise loop of the waterfront with a short run west to start.
<!---->
Not much to write about as I felt pretty good for the most part.  I had a gel at an hour and ten minutes in (Salted Watermelon Gu).  The rain started near the _UVic Campus_, so I made a beeline for home on _McKenzie Avenue_.  That put me in back at the _Switch Bridge_ with 9 minutes still on the clock.  I could have done a bit (a lot) more but I called it a ride.

### WATERFRONT LOOP

I spend some time with the foam roller before dinner and was surprised at how sore my hamstrings (both) were.

### NOTES
Total Time: **85 minutes**

Another pretty restful sleep last night.

I checked in with work and completed a quick task before starting today's workouts.  

At 10am, there was a calm before the storm and that was more than enough reason to get out the door for an easy 6km.
<!---->
I felt pretty good on the run too with just a hint of soreness in the left piriformis and hamstring junction.  I thought it was an easy effort out to _Quadra_ and back along _Lochside Trail_ but my HR monitor said I was working a bit harder.

Once home, I had just enough time for some toast and honey, to mix a bottle of Gatorade and get out the door for the pool session.

The swim was as I was expecting it would be after a bit of running.  There was a heaviness to my arms but other than that, the swim went ok.  I miss counted a 150m rep, going longer (200m) but cut the cool down by 50m to make up the difference.

Pretty solid morning!  Now that afternoon storm can blow through.

### NOTES
Total Time: **150 minutes**

TLDR: **Solid afternoon, bike and run**.

All morning and into the afternoon, I would look out the window to the west and see sunshine here in town, but dark ominous clouds surrounding _Mount Stewart_, where if I take the XC Bike, I'd surely be soaked.  After watching just too much of the incomprehensible activity going on in _Washington, D.C._, I had to go.
<!---->
What a fantastic afternoon!  No sooner than I rode to _Thetis Lake Park_, the skies cleared.  The trails near the base of Scafe Hill were soggy wet but the further I went, the better the fire roads became.  I pushed on past _Mount Stewart_ and explored further up the road.  The fire roads became _Kallie's Korner_; a single track trail that took me the rest of the way to _Munn Road_.  I coasted downhill, past the trailheads into the _Mount Work Regional Park_ but did go off-road once more before connecting with _Prospect Lake Road_.  There was another connecting trail that would have taken me to _Hector Road_ but it was in mud soup, so it would be on asphalt for the rest of the ride.

### ALMOST LIKE ONE BIG HILL
![Elevation Chart](/assets/jpg/bikeprofile-20210106.jpeg)
<!---->
Apart from walking a tricky section and a few creek crossings, the ride went really well.
### RIDE MAP
![Ride Map](/assets/jpg/ridemap-20210106.jpeg)

Getting home I still had a capitalized "NOT" off the bike, easy effort run to do.  I debated _"when to run"_ for a short bit as I had a bit of daylight left and a belly full of sugar from the ride.  Off with the bike kit, on with the run kit and I was back out the door.

I felt good, jogging the _Goose_ toward the water.  I turned around at _Harbour Road_ and it was then, I really started to get the hint that my legs had some good stimulus today.  Effort was easy, though I found a bit of a kick for the last 800m.

## THURSDAY JAN 07 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
45 minute easy spin on the trainer. Really light. 
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort.   
Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

Another wonderful _"sleep-in"_ morning.

A spot came up at the Esquimalt pool so I repeated [Tuesday's workout](javascript:flick('tue');).  Four of us swimming the moderate lane(s) made for some congestion; not a big deal as everything worked out.  I did feel **a bit more tired** while doing the lengths compared to my memory of the same workout just two days ago.

After the swim, I had a choice of easy run or easy bike.  The tired feeling during the swim made the decision for me.  I sat on the trainer for 45 minutes; effort was **super easy**.

What a fantastic afternoon to be on a road bike!

I needed to drop off a laptop at my boss's home so I worked that into the ride.  That lead into a longer conversation which did eat into available daylight; it is January but you would never know it with a sunny and windless 11¬∞C afternoon.

I travelled the _Lochside Route_ north to _Sidney_ and once I was there, I stopped briefly to put on a jacket, have a second gel before tracing my path south.
<!---->
I felt **good to great** this afternoon.  Partly because of a big pasta dinner the night before, partly due the on bike fuelling but I really think the weather had a HUGE part in keeping my spirits high from start to finish.

### SUNSET BEFORE FINALLY HEADING IN
![Sunset over Portage Inlet](/assets/jpg/sunset-20210108.jpeg?v3)

I am noticing the quads are feeling **worked over** now that the bike is washed and put away.

## SATURDAY JAN 09 üå§
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 90 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort. Stay fueled. Keep it easy. 
2nd: Spin 40 minutes on the trainer. Finishing up a big week with a short easy spin.   
Mobility 18 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

Bacon, eggs, potatoes and english muffins with jam to start the weekend.  Then a new run warm up routine before heading out the door.

On the run, I immediately set a familiar goal of making the last 10 minutes feel as comfortable as the first.  There was next to **no pop** in the legs and this had the potential to be a mentally long run.  I stuck to my plan through _Downtown, James Bay, Dallas Road_ and a bit of _Beacon Hill Park_; easy effort, good posture and keep it comfortable.
<!---->
I thought I was starting to feel the fade before the _Selkirk Trestle_ but the last 10 minutes was as comfortable enough to call _"Goal Accomplished"_ for this run.

### NICE MORNING ALONG DALLAS ROAD
![Run Map](/assets/jpg/runmap-20210109.jpeg?v2)

My watch read **5:48/km** which I was surprised as I would have thought the pace was much slower.  My heart rate, measured from the strap apparently averaged **139 BPM** so maybe I was working harder than I thought; who knows?

---
Although a 40 minute spin would put me at 14 hours of training for the week, I am feeling like an evening off would be just as beneficial.
