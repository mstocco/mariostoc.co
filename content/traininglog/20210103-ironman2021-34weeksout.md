# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 3, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**34 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
If [last week](ironman2021-35weeksout) showed me anything, it is that I really need to do a better job of recognizing and paying heed to the different stressors that may come up.  It is time to start putting more raw veggies on the plate too.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

I had a good sleep last night and woke feeling refreshed.

The Seahawks were up 6 - 3 over the 49ers midway through the 2nd quarter when I headed out the door for the run.  I thought I'd change up the route and make my way to the _Maplewood/Blenkinsop Road_ area and then figure out a way to incorporate [Christmas Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);).

It didn't take too long to figure out that there wasn't much juice in the legs this afternoon which encouraged me to settle into a conservative pace early. 
<!---->
Around the 42 minute mark, I had a really nice surprise.  My cousin Tania and her husband David noticed me jogging on _Cedar Hill X-Road_.  I stopped my watch and we had a wonderful twenty minute visit.      

Getting going again meant another warm up and reinforced that conservative pace that I was chugging along with during the fist part of this workout.  I made it to the base of Christmas Hill but after leaving the road, the trail was muddy and wet.  I walked most of the trail to the top.  Once at the top, I stopped to snap a picture for this week before walking down the west side of the hill until I was back on a dry trail.

Regardless of stopping twice on today run, the last 10 minutes felt more like the end of a 2 hour run versus the 80th minute.

### NOTES

Sleep was ok last night.  I slept in too but in moving around this morning, I am feeling the [yesterday's run](javascript:flick('sun');) (stiff).

With intermittent showers in the vicinity, I picked the road bike and did a counterclockwise loop of the waterfront with a short run west to start.
<!---->
Not much to write about as I felt pretty good for the most part.  I had a gel at an hour and ten minutes in (Salted Watermelon Gu).  The rain started near the _UVic Campus_, so I made a beeline for home on _McKenzie Avenue_.  That put me in back at the _Switch Bridge_ with 9 minutes still on the clock.  I could have done a bit (a lot) more but I called it a ride.

### WATERFRONT LOOP

I spend some time with the foam roller before dinner and was surprised at how sore my hamstrings (both) were.

<p class="weather synopsis">Strong southeasterly winds of 70 to 90 km/h winds are occurring over Inner South Coast today.</p>

### NOTES
Total Time: **85 minutes**

Another pretty restful sleep last night.

I checked in with work and completed a quick task before starting today's workouts.  

At 10am, there was a calm before the storm and that was more than enough reason to get out the door for an easy 6km.
<!---->
I felt pretty good on the run too with just a hint of soreness in the left piriformis and hamstring junction.  I thought it was an easy effort out to _Quadra_ and back along _Lochside Trail_ but my HR monitor said I was working a bit harder.

Once home, I had just enough time for some toast and honey, to mix a bottle of Gatorade and get out the door for the pool session.

The swim was as I was expecting it would be after a bit of running.  There was a heaviness to my arms but other than that, the swim went ok.  I miss counted a 150m rep, going longer (200m) but cut the cool down by 50m to make up the difference.

Pretty solid morning!  Now that afternoon storm can blow through.

### NOTES
Total Time: **150 minutes**

All morning and into the afternoon, I would look out the window to the west and see sunshine here in town, but dark ominous clouds surrounding _Mount Stewart_, where if I go for an MTB ride, I'd surely be soaked.  After watching just too much of the incomprehensible activity going on in _Washington, D.C._, I had to just go.

What a fantastic afternoon it was too.  No sooner as I rode into _Thetis Lake Park_, the skies cleared.  The trails near the base of Scafe Hill were soggy wet but the further up I went, the better the fire roads became.  I pushed on past _Mount Stewart_ and explored further up the road.  The fire roads became _Kali's Korner_; a single track trail that took me the rest of the way to _Munn Road_.  I coasted past the trailheads into the _Mount Work Regional Park_ but did go off-road before connecting with _Prospect Lake Road_.  There was connecting trail that would have taken me to _Hector Road_ but it was in pretty bad shape (mud pit) so I was on asphalt for the remainder of the ride.

Apart from walking a tricky section and a few creek crossings, the ride went really well.

Getting home I still had a capitalized "NOT" off the bike, easy effort run to do.  I debated for a bit as I had a bit of daylight left and a belly full of sugar from the ride.  Off with the bike kit, on with the run kit and I was back out the door.  I felt good to start, jogging down _The Goose_ toward the water.  After 20 minutes, I turned around at _Harbour Road_ and it was then I really started to get the hint that my legs have had their share of stimulus for the day.
