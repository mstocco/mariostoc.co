# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 24, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**31 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
My goal this week is to be a bit more recovery _"focused"_ .  There is a MTB ride scheduled for [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) which looks like fun too.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **STAYING ON SCHEDULE**

The goal was to get a bit more recovery in this week and for the most part, I think that was accomplished.  I don't feel beat 
up or run down even though my cumulative training time for this week (11:43) was within 5 minutes of [last week](ironman2021-32weeksout).  

Work has given me an additional project which will be an opportunity to test my time management abilities in the upcoming weeks...

## SUNDAY JAN 24 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **1** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
*5 minute warm up/loosen up before the run*.  
1st: Run 1:40. On flat or rolling terrain. Ideally on some dirt. Goose, Thetis, Elk Lake, ect. Stay fueled! At least 200 calories on this run. More would be ok with me. 
Effort is easy/covering ground for the entire run.

2nd: Spin 45 minutes easy to loosen up your legs.

### NOTES
Total Time: **148 minutes**

For the first time in a what feels like a month, my soleus felt tender to start the run; that didn't last very long though (less than a kilometre).  What did last was **heavy legs**.  What a difference a week makes!  [Last Sunday](/ironman2021-32weeksout?sun) I was feeling light and energetic on my feet; today was the opposite.  Regardless, I kept to the plan of easy effort and aerobically, that was the result.
<!---->
I split the 100 minute scheduled time into 3rds and had a gel (Gu Lemonade flavoured _"Roctane"_) at the 33rd and 66th minute.  I finished 500ml of water too.  Taking a full gel in one go instead of smaller portions will need some practice as the second packet didn't sit 100% comfortably.

I was on the trainer pretty quick after getting home; I even stayed in my run kit (but with cycling shoes).  As soon as I started pedalling, I noticed my right vastus medialis muscle was talking to me.  I kept the turnover light and settled into the 2nd quarter of the _Bills vs Chiefs_ game.  Being on the trainer without a chamois was ok (or I was too tired to notice).

I rolled out the hamstrings, adductors and glutes really well after the spin too.

## TUESDAY JAN 26 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes. Easy spinning. Any bike. Inside or outside.   
Run 45 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 minutes**

I choice to put the front wheel on my TT bike and balance **on the rollers** tonight.  I felt pretty good on the bike; easy effort with a nice turnover.  

The run was not quite off the bike.  I needed to bundle up with some winter running kit.  I was going to do a typical (but lengthened) out and back to _Quadra Street_ on the bike path but when I reached the turnaround, I decided to run on the lit sidewalks instead of the pitch black trail.  That had me head up the shallow but stead grade to _Tattersall Drive_; I was worried that I would be longer than the scheduled 45 minutes but evidently, I was back to my starting point in 40.

## WEDNESDAY JAN 27 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes: Most likely on the trainer. 20 minutes easy to warm up. 5x :15 moderate effort standing, :45 easy/seated. 6x 1:00 high cadence, 1:30 easy after each. 2:00 easy. 8x 2:30 @ an effort you could hold for 30-40 minutes, 2:30 easy spinning after each. Easy spinning to cool down.   
Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I was up far early than I wanted.  

Today was a harder to focus day at work.  I could have pushed away from the keyboard in the afternoon and gone for a road ride but I didn't have much of an appetite for getting cold (Looking out the window, I can see a fresh dusting of snow on the _Malahat_).
<!---->
When I did get into the garage for the bike workout, I was tired but I found a groove early on and this ended up being a pretty **solid effort**.  I didn't record any heart rate data (forgot the strap) but there I did get a pretty good burn in the quads.

### REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE

I had a XC bike race from 2018 on the screen with the volume down and podcast playing in the background.  Time for dinner!

Sleep **5** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1:30pm: Swim 2200: 
2 rounds (100 easy free, 100 steady w/ buoy, 50 as 25 fist drill/25 strong finish to the stroke rest as needed)

Run 60 minutes: 35 minutes easy/flat running. 12x :30 strides (Keep these controlled!), :45 easy running after each. 10 minutes easy to finish up

### NOTES
Total Time: **110 minutes**

Both Carina and I woke with headaches this morning; this feels like a hangover or an MSG headache and it may have been the sauce used in a new recipe for dinner.  Needless to say, no leftovers for me this afternoon.
<!---->
It was the _Esquimalt Pool_ for today's swim.  The maintenance at _Crystal Pool_ has completed and they are accepting reservations for February as of today; I grabbed 2 morning slots (50m) at Crystal Pool, 2 weeks from now.  Today's swim felt good to great; lot's of pull-buoy work and I am **getting comfortable** enough to notice some asymmetries between my dominant and non-dominant sides.  Cool!  Something I think I can improve on.

The run was what it was.  It felt like a run after a 2200m swim; not fresh but not wrecked either.  The first 4 strides sucked and felt terribly awkward.  The last 4 strides were the opposite, feeling comfortable and controlled.

## FRIDAY JAN 29 ‚òÅÔ∏è

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

8 rounds (25 FAST r :15, 75 relaxed/smooth r :30) 100 easy to cool down.   
Mobility 25 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 minutes**

I had an ok sleep last night but focus at work was a bit off.

I did feel good in the pool tonight though.  I was expecting to feel sore, sluggish, tired, all of the above but none of those things transpired.  The 8 rounds of 25m/75m were **solid efforts** with consistent times for the _"fast"_ lengths.

## SATURDAY JAN 30
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:30 on the MTB or road bike. Looking at the long term forecast, I'm going to guess MTB. Easy to steady effort. 
Aiming for over a liter of liquid and at least 750 calories.

Off the bike: Run 30 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort. 

### NOTES
Total Moving Time: **165 minutes**

I woke up this morning feeling rested; what a nice way to start a Saturday!

The weather was nice enough to go either way, road bike or mountain bike.  I picked the mountain bike just because it is a bit of a different stimulus than the _"Lands End Loop"_ that I have been riding the past couple of weekends.  Besides, I bought new tires for my XC bike and I was looking to try them out.
<!---->
Before I headed out, I looked on the map and thought I would be able to link Thetis and Mount Work Parks using the Mount Work Park Entrance off _Munn Road_.  Unfortunately, the 2 trailhead I found from that spot were marked hikers only (no biking).  I wasn't into riding down _Munn Road_ from here so I headed up and over _Munn_, turned right on _Millstream_ and entered the north end of the park off of _Ross Durrance Road_.

This put me on _Regional Trail North_ and it was a grunt for me to get up and over the top of that hill.  Once recovered on the way down, I took my favourite _Executive West_ trail out of _Mount Work Park_.

**Calories Consumed :**  500 calories in jujubes and 330 calories in lemonade crystals mixed in 1.3 litres of water.  There was 100ml left in my camelback bladder when I got home.  I'd round down to call it 800 calories total.

---
I did not run off the bike tonight.  I was needed at home.
