# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 24, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

## WEEKLY GOAL
My goal this week is to be a bit more recovery _"focused"_ .  There is a MTB ride scheduled for [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) which looks like fun too.

## SUMMARY

## SUNDAY JAN 24 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **1** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
*5 minute warm up/loosen up before the run*.  
1st: Run 1:40. On flat or rolling terrain. Ideally on some dirt. Goose, Thetis, Elk Lake, ect. Stay fueled! At least 200 calories on this run. More would be ok with me. 
Effort is easy/covering ground for the entire run.

2nd: Spin 45 minutes easy to loosen up your legs.

### NOTES
Total Time: **148 minutes**

For the first time in a what feels like a month, my soleus felt tender to start the run; that didn't last very long though (less than a kilometre).  What did last was **heavy legs**.  What a difference a week makes!  [Last Sunday](/ironman2021-32weeksout?sun) I was feeling light and energetic on my feet; today was the opposite.  Regardless, I kept to the plan of easy effort and aerobically, that was the result.

I split the 100 minute scheduled time into 3rds and had a gel (Gu Lemonade flavoured _"Roctane"_) at the 33rd and 66th minute.  I finished 500ml of water too.  Taking a full gel in one go instead of smaller portions will need some practice as the second packet didn't sit 100% comfortably.

I was on the trainer pretty quick after getting home; I even stayed in my run kit (but with cycling shoes).  As soon as I started pedalling, I noticed my right vastus medialis muscle was talking to me.  I kept the turnover light and settled into the 2nd quarter of the _Bills vs Chiefs_ game.  Being on the trainer without a chamois was ok (or I was too tired to notice).

I rolled out the hamstrings, adductors and glutes really well after the spin too.
