<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.
 
1st: Ride 90 minutes on the MTB. Ride whatever route sounds the most FUN. Easy to steady effort. I'm sure you'll have to dig deep to get up a climb or two. That is expected. Enjoy a sunny day on the trails!

2nd: Does NOT have to be off the bike, run 60 minutes. Very flat route. Aka: Path running. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **153 minutes**

Plenty of fatigue in my legs from the ride [yesterday](ironmam2021-20weeksout?sat).  I took it super easy up _Highland Road_ to the north end of _Thetis Lake Park_.  My thoughts were about the hour run afterward, at least until I was in the park with the entire forest to myself.

"[Comfy Wooden Chair](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/comfy-wooden-chair/)" is a short XC trail that is just technical enough for where my MTB skills are at.  I rode it a couple weeks ago and it wasn't pretty.  I decided to give it another go this afternoon.  I solved a couple of problems, a couple other parts I have yet to link together.

The single track ends at _Bellamy Trail_.  With just 40 minutes on the clock, I tackled a "rock garden" of a hill before doubling back to attempt _Comfy Wooden Chair_ again.  Second time around was better than the first and I headed south out of the park from there.

There is another hill on _Bellamy_ that throws a heck of a punch.  I cleared that one this afternoon too. This ride was fun.

A little before 1800, I set off for a jog to the _Inner Harbour_.

There was really not much left in my legs.  I did my best to fabricate a rhythm and I sort of did ok with that.  I was not challenged aerobically and I used that to focus on posture.  I had about a hundred calories worth of Maynards candy before heading out the door and packed another hundred with me for the jog.

By 7km, my feet were getting tired too.

Time for a spaghetti dinner and then off to bed.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.    
Run 75 minutes. Choose a route with a few rollers/hills. You could head over to Cedar Hill, you could run the hill down the street that you used to do. This does NOT need a lot of elevation, but you have the all clear to run a few "not flat" sections.
