### PLANNED WORKOUT
Short spin to/from pool. 10 minutes each way. 
5:30am: Swim 2200: 
3 rounds (100 easy swim r :20, 2x 50 kick/steady r :10, 2x 50 as 25 fist drill/25 strong finish to stroke r :15) 
8 rounds (50 building from easy to strong, 50 Strong (something you could hold for 400-500 meters), 50 EASY. r :20 after each) 
2x 50 super easy to cool down well. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 minutes**

I've had a knot in my back, between the shoulder blades for a few days now but last night, I must have slept awkward because that knot was aggravated enough to wake me up last night.  Before riding to the pool, I spent time with a lacrosse ball to work out the tension.

In the pool, that knot was not noticed and as I write this, it is still in a good spot.

The swim overall was telling in that I am still (likely) feeling the ride [two days ago](ironman2021-16weeksout?sat).  My times on some of the 50m lengths reflect that.  Regardless, I swam the strong lengths to the best I had for the day and swam the easy lengths easy.  The continuous lane did get a bit congested and I did the last of the workout in the fast lane once that lane cleared out.

The ride home was the big tell with regards to my level of fatigue.

## TUESDAY MAY 18
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
This can be a brick or split. Your choice. It can also be a run-bike brick. Just get in the time. And have fun. 
Ride 90 minutes. No intervals but.... get in lots of climbs. You could.....ride up Willis point a few times, you could do all the climbs off the waterfront, you could even ride Mount Doug if you wanted. You have 90 minutes. Effort is "easy between climbs". And up the climbs the effort is... "get up the climb". But.... a lot of those climbs are steep enough that the effort to get up them is significant. Just like Tour of Flanders. 
Run 30 minutes. Easy route. Easy effort.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.  
Run 80 minutes. Hilly route. Easy effort. 
Cedar hill would be great. But you can literally run anywhere with some hills. Thetis, loops around Beacon hill works. Anywhere!
Have fun on rolling terrain.
