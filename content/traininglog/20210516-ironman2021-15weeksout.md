<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine. 
Run 70 minutes. Running around Elk Lake or a similar trail would be ideal. Easy effort. Spending some time on the feet. 
aka: Flatter route. No need to go uphills after the long Saturday ride!

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **11 km**

First real bout of hay fever after mowing the lawn and doing some weeding in the yard today.

I had a pretty good nap mid-afternoon too. 

Another sunset jog around Elk/Beaver Lake on a Sunday.  This was a taken at a **very easy pace**, whether I wanted to or not.  I may not describe myself as being completely smoked from the ride yesterday but I certainly was not fresh.  Good form for the first hour and things started to fall apart as I got closer to my truck.

## MONDAY MAY 17 ☁️
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Short spin to/from pool. 10 minutes each way. 
5:30am: Swim 2200: 
3 rounds (100 easy swim r :20, 2x 50 kick/steady r :10, 2x 50 as 25 fist drill/25 strong finish to stroke r :15) 
8 rounds (50 building from easy to strong, 50 Strong (something you could hold for 400-500 meters), 50 EASY. r :20 after each) 
2x 50 super easy to cool down well. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2200m**

I've had a knot in my back, between the shoulder blades for a few days now but last night, I must have slept awkward because that knot was aggravated enough to wake me up last night.  Before riding to the pool, I spent time with a lacrosse ball to work out the tension.

That knot went unnoticed in the pool; massage and the swim seem to have helped.

The swim overall was telling in that I am still (likely) feeling the ride [two days ago](ironman2021-16weeksout?sat).  My times on some of the 50m lengths reflect that.  Regardless, I swam the strong lengths to the best I had for the day and swam the easy lengths easy.  The continuous lane did get a bit congested and I did the last of the workout in the fast lane once that lane cleared out.

The ride home was the big tell with regards to my level of fatigue in my quads; I am not back yet.  A raw spot on the undercarriage developed from Saturday's ride too.

## TUESDAY MAY 18
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
This can be a brick or split. Your choice. It can also be a run-bike brick. Just get in the time. And have fun. 
Ride 90 minutes. No intervals but.... get in lots of climbs. You could.....ride up Willis point a few times, you could do all the climbs off the waterfront, you could even ride Mount Doug if you wanted. You have 90 minutes. Effort is "easy between climbs". And up the climbs the effort is... "get up the climb". But.... a lot of those climbs are steep enough that the effort to get up them is significant. Just like Tour of Flanders. 
Run 30 minutes. Easy route. Easy effort. 


### NOTES
Total Time: **35 minutes**

So I have been doing okay riding and swimming during the early mornings ([yesterday](javascript:flick('mon');) for example) but waking up and going for a 30 minute jog felt like a big shock to the system.  Right ankle was tender for the first kilometre but it did relax.  The muscle tissue from the knee to mid-thigh felt pretty cooked and didn't come around until I was almost home.  Despite that tired feeling, seeing myself in the reflection of the windows of a strip mall, my form looked okay; meaning I wasn't hinged at the waist.

Then I did something a bit different.  Running past the soccer field, I decided to kick off my shoes and socks for a couple of barefoot laps on the artificial turf.  This felt great!  I made sure to limit it to two laps because it has been a few years since I attempted this.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.  
Run 80 minutes. Hilly route. Easy effort. 
Cedar hill would be great. But you can literally run anywhere with some hills. Thetis, loops around Beacon hill works. Anywhere!
Have fun on rolling terrain.
