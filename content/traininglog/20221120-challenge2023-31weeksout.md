I could have ridden outside _(again)_ as their was still a weather window in the afternoon.  Instead, I watched the closing kilometres of IM Arizona _(procrastination)_  before I threw a leg over the trainer and completed the workout as written.

#### POWER ZONES

I feel like there was **really good stimulus** in the 70 seconds reps.  Those reps were challenging and I finished a great spin with a smile.

A fantastic afternoon to push away from the computer, put some and get outside;  the rain stopped too. My Tuesday crew didn't get back to me so I went solo on my typical dirt circuit.

My friend, Matt P. was leading a TripleShot group ride on the trail.  He spotted me and it was great to stop briefly and say hello.

**Effort was easy** and after I got home, I felt good enough to spin easy for 30 minutes on the trainer.

Inside option selected as the weather began to deteriorate in the afternoon.

My free trial of _Rouvy_ expired so I downloaded _Fulgaz_.  The new app froze twice on me in 15 minutes; I shut it down and put on the _YouTube_ (more bike coverage of last weekend's _IM Arizona_).  Nothing much to report except more time **easy spinning** the legs.

Had a **nice afternoon** to ride to and from the pool.  New bike racks installed at _Crystal Pool_ too; room for the wide handlebars on the XC bike (awesome).

Got the workout in _just_ before the 25m lanes went in.  I am going to have to get to the pool a bit earlier.  The watch recorded this workout as 2450m but it was completed as written.

### NOTES
Total Time: **59 Mins** &nbsp;Run: **9.4 km** &nbsp;Swim: **0000m**

Despite a sound sleep, my right ankle is still a bit sore this morning.

Workout order flipped so I could swim in a 50m lane (1530 @Crystal Pool).

<!----->
The run was just so-so this afternoon; just not the same spring underfoot as previous trips along [Colquitz Creek](javascript:flkty.select(2);).   Maybe it was the effort on the trainer [yesterday](javascript:flick('fri');), maybe it is the drop in pressure as the next storm approaches.

There is a tender knot in my right glute max that will need some work.

---

This felt like the most **intense swim workout** that I've done.  50m gassers with fast people (UVic swim caps and a strong triathlete) in the lane with me.  I thought about stopping early and calling it a productive week (more than once).  Then I'd do another length and before I knew it, I was at the 200m cooldown.

I am going to sleep like a rock tonight.
