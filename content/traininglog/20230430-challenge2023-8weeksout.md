### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **3200m**

Back is a bit more stiff upon waking.   Probably the 40 minutes on the trainer last night didn't help.

I spent the morning cheer on Carina as she completed the TC10K.  I walked point to point accumulating > 11,000 steps in doing so.

In the pool, I mis-entered the workout, and I missed the 2x50 SF w/Paddes and a 100m.  100m w/best form yielded a 1:42 with minimal, single leg push off the wall and I felt like that was a good representation of me today.  The ladder up to 400m and then back down was completed almost as written; there was a dude that was watching from the pool deck, jumped into my lane and pushed off doing _"froggy kick"_ right in front of me.  I was at 200m of one of the 400m sets when he did it.  I jumped into the other lane and upped my effort to match a young guy's speed (well about my 1/2 IM pace).

Eventually, I moved myself but into the lane that I started in and swam the last bit at my intended pace.
