# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, September 27, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(3);)

**52 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Heading into this week, I feel like I have some momentum from the consistancy from [last week](ironman2021-49weeksout).  The brick workout on [Tuesday](javascript:flkty.select(5);) and the track workout on [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(7);) look to be important days.  My goal is to nail those workouts and enjoy the balance of the activities scheduled this week.

## SUMMARY
I feel like I was **RIGHT WHERE I NEED TO BE**.

I was able to carry last week's momentum into this training week and I got the scheduled work in.  The volume and intensity is right on the money for where I am at too.  I did start to feel the total load on [Friday](javascript:flkty.select(11);) but I addressed it with a bit more rest.

The fall weather was really nice this week with mostly sunny skies and perfect training temperatures. I am **happy and thankful**.

## SUNDAY SEP 27 ðŸŒ¥
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 20 minutes  
Run 70 minutes. Hilly route. On trails would be nice. But not 
mandatory. Keep the effort EASY. And bring a gel. Always good 
to practice.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12 km**

Today was a mostly cloudy, humid, 15&#8451;.  I headed out on my Helmcken route with the idea of adding in few more undulations.   This was a pretty routine, **easy effort run**; I kept it controlled on the uphills and comfortable everywhere else. I enjoyed a packet of _"Macha LattÃ©"_ flavoured ReKarb at the 40 minute mark; it sat ok with me.  I started to feel a bout of heavy legs for the final 10 minutes; meaning coach nailed the right amount of run for today.

## MONDAY SEP 28 â˜€
Sleep **1** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
22 Minute Full Body Mobility Routine V3.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Early to bed last night and I had a solid night's sleep.  Regardless, I still feeling yesterday's run in my legs this morning.

By 16:00 and after being on the computer all day, I looked out the window at the nice weather and thought about how nice it would be to get a run in.  I passed knowing that I have a plan for [tomorrow](javascript:flkty.select(5);) and [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(7);).

Today was a **recovery day**.

## TUESDAY SEP 29 â˜€
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 60 minutes. Easy spinning. You can head outside if you 
like. But this is to save some time.   
Run (can be directly before or after the ride) 30 minutes. Flat 
route. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 minutes**

I did not sleep that well last night; maybe to much time on the keyboard yesterday.  My neck and left hip feel stiff and I will hit the foam roller before heading out on the ride.

The weather couldn't have been nicer.  Seriously today was nicer than a typical summer day.  It would have been a waste to have ridden the rollers this afternoon.  That being said, I really didn't have a route planned so I hopped on the TT bike and pedalled.  I ended up doing the Dallas Road/Beach Drive route.  No real focus except to enjoy the sunshine.
<!---->
I did stop for a bit to say hello to an old hockey buddy who was out for a walk.  This was very much an **easy ride** and I did put back a 750ml bottle with 53g of Gatorade while being out on the road.

Getting back home, I didn't waste much time getting into the Nikes and heading out towards Quadra.  Quads, hammies and glutes felt ok but my soleus' were pretty lit up and my ankles (Fibularis Tertius) were sore too.  The soreness did begin to calm down after about 25 minutes (on a false flat, downhill).  This run OTB was a **focus on form** type of effort.

Ride Distance: **27 km** &nbsp; Moving Time: **1:07:00**

## WEDNESDAY SEP 30 â˜€
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 12 minutes | Run: Track

* 15 minutes easy to warm up.
* 5x 100 meter strides a touch slower than 5k effort, 100 meter EASY jog.
* 3x 300 @ 5k effort/pace. 1:17-1:21 is a good goal. 100 meter WALK. This is all a warm up. Going faster will only hurt the actual workout.
* 20 minutes tempo @ 1/2 marathon effort/feel. Please try and keep things under control. Especially the first 2k or so.
* 15 minutes easy running to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **65 minutes** (+30 mins on the bike)

I had a decent sleep last night.

The hip mobility routine was done before heading to the track.  It worked out some stiffness in my adductors that I didn't know were tight...
<!---->
So I had this run workout ear-marked ever since I saw it hit my inbox.  It was NOT another attempt at 12.5 laps but it was a chance to **nail some paces** on the track.

The warm up went ok; my soleus' took their time to loosen up and they did _before_ the first set of 100s.  The 5x100s may have been the trickiest for me to get right as before I had a chance to settle into a pace, the effort was over.  The 3x300s on the other hand came in as **1:19.2**, **1:19.4** and **1:20.1** with the last one feeling the easiest.

The 20 minute tempo was run at my most consistent effort of **5:05/km**.  This may be a touch faster than the 1/2 Marathon pace but it was less than my 10K effort.  It was a fun rhythm that I found easy to lock into an stay at for 20 minutes.

## THURSDAY OCT 01 â˜€
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:15 on the MTB or on some hilly roads. Overall an easy/fun 
effort. I'm sure you'll be fairly tired from the day before.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes**

Another solid sleep last night and I am still feeling a _"runner's high"_ from yesterday's workout.

This was a more **spirited ride** than I was expecting to be able to have; my legs didn't feel overly fatigued from last night's effort on the track (maybe a little).  I felt good and not just by my own perception; Strava confirmed as much awarding me a few PR's for some of segments on the loop.

I arrived at the trailhead right at sundown. That, I figured, would give me about 30 minutes of good light to get through the forest.
<!---->
I hadn't hit any single track trails in a while and _"Comfy Wooden Chair"_ is really only 5 minutes long so I turned off the fire road for a bit of an extra challenge; this wasn't my cleanest run on this section but it was still fun.  Getting on to Bellamy Trail had me out of the park and back into the sub-divsion in no time.  In fact, I was home 5 minutes ahead of schedule.

One thing though...  I am going to have to be more diligent at putting my bikes away, ready for their next use.  Playing bike mechanic after work with waning daylight will be a thing in the next month.

## FRIDAY OCT 02 â˜€
Sleep **4** |<mark> Fatigue **5** </mark>| Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 20 minutes  
Run 40 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **31 minutes**

I did not sleep as well as I have been throughout this week; I woke with a hint of a headache. After a mentally hard day on the keyboard, I felt **exhausted** and went down for a 30 minute nap.

I headed out for an easy lap of Swan Lake knowing that today had been an _off-day_ right from the start. About a minute before turning off the asphalt and on to the dirt, I noticed that I was running comfortable and that I could probably do the whole 40 minutes on the bike path.  Nevertheless, I hit the trail knowing that was the healthiest option for me today.  I stopped after 31 minutes, took in an amazing sunset through the forest fire smoke and walked the last bit home.

## SATURDAY OCT 03 â˜€
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:30 on TT bike. Generally flatter route (Up the peninsula) Remembering to eat at least 200 calories an hour. Effort is easy to steady. Nothing too crazy. Just a nice weekend ride. 
Off the bike: Run 30 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **155 minutes**

I slept ok last night but I noticed some fatigue (not soreness) in my legs when walking up the stairs this morning.

Getting out on the TT Bike in the afternoon, I continued to feel the **fatigue in my legs**.  This stuck with me through my trip up the peninsula.  That feeling started to go way by the time I got to the airport (an hour in) and I felt okay for the next 45 minutes (through Lands End Road, back to Tatlow Road).
<!---->
Things started to get uncomfortable on my second trip to Lands End Road.  In particular my saddle was becoming increasingly uncomfortable and my lumbar started to protest.

I took a spin back to the airport to eat up some time that I had left on the clock before finishing at my brother-in-law's house in Sidney.

The scheduled 30 minute run off the bike was a **20-minute torture test**.  I think this all adds up to me not bringing enough sugar on the ride; my mistake, my lesson learned.
