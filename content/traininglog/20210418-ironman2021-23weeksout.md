# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, April 18, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**23 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
The goal this week is to simply duplicate the productivity of [last week](ironman2021-20weeksout).

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **ON THE EDGE** but not entirely due to training stress.

The +14 hours of training [last week](ironman2021-20weeksout) plus what life gave me this week gave me a reason to pause.  I replaced the scheduled run on [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');) with a walk.

The run of 13 days of sunny weather ended this week too.

## SUNDAY APR 18
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.
 
1st: Ride 90 minutes on the MTB. Ride whatever route sounds the most FUN. Easy to steady effort. I'm sure you'll have to dig deep to get up a climb or two. That is expected. Enjoy a sunny day on the trails!

2nd: Does NOT have to be off the bike, run 60 minutes. Very flat route. Aka: Path running. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **153 minutes**

Plenty of fatigue in my legs from the ride [yesterday](ironmam2021-20weeksout?sat).  I took it super easy up _Highland Road_ to the north end of _Thetis Lake Park_.  My thoughts were about how to complete an hour run later.  At least those thoughts lasted until I was in the park with the entire forest to myself.
<!---->
[Comfy Wooden Chair](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/comfy-wooden-chair/) is a short XC trail that is just technical enough for my current MTB skillset.  I rode it a couple weeks ago and it wasn't pretty.  I decided to give it another go this afternoon.  I solved a couple of problems, a couple other parts I have yet to link together.

The single track ends at _Bellamy Trail_.  With just 40 minutes on the clock, I tackled a "rock garden" of a hill before doubling back to attempt _Comfy Wooden Chair_ again.  Second time around was better than the first and I headed south out of the park from there.

There is another hill on _Bellamy_ that throws a heck of a punch.  I cleared that one this afternoon too. **This ride was fun.**

### AN HOUR-FIFTEEN LATER...
A little before 1800, I set off for a jog to the _Inner Harbour_.

There was really not much left in my legs.  I did my best to fabricate a rhythm and I sort of did ok with that.  I was not challenged aerobically and I used that to focus on posture.

I had about a hundred calories worth of Maynards candy before heading out the door and packed another hundred with me for the jog.

By 7km, my feet were getting tired too.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
5:30am: Swim 2100: 
3 rounds (2x 50 easy free, 50 swim w/ fins, 50 kick on side w/ fins, switching/rotating every 6-10 kicks. R :20 after each) 
4 rounds (50 w/ 3x sighting, 50 gradual build easy to strong, 50 easy. r :20 after each)

Just under 6 hours of sleep but I did feel rested at 0500.  No need for winter kit on the commute to the pool this morning!

In the pool, I really felt the weekend.  It wasn't any one thing (legs/arms) but a general feeling of fatigue and a need to push through it.

### Normalized Swim Paces
![Swim Paces](/assets/jpg/swim-20210419.jpeg)

The ride home is where it really hit me that there is a good deal of fatigue in my legs.

A dude on an e-bike rode up behind to me as I turned onto _Pandora Avenue_ and followed me across the _Johnson Street Bridge_ then north on the bike path.  He stayed right there too; a metre or two back, drafting off _me_ on my mountain bike.  My legs were screaming and I don't know why I felt the need to race someone with a throttle.  Worse yet, I don't know why I got inwardly upset when the dude wasn't willing to take a pull.  

I need food and a coffee.

## TUESDAY APR 20 ☀️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** |<mark> Stress **5** | Soreness **5**&nbsp;</mark>  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.    
Run 75 minutes. Choose a route with a few rollers/hills. You could head over to Cedar Hill, you could run the hill down the street that you used to do. This does NOT need a lot of elevation, but you have the all clear to run a few "not flat" sections. 
Easy effort overall. Bring at least 100 calories. 

### NOTES
I got a bit of a sleep-in this morning (nice) but I am feeling a little beat up; ankles and hips in particular.

Life hit me hard this evening.  Started the run but pulled the plug and just walked.  50 minutes of walking, thinking, processing.  Once home, I did a long session of stretching and lacrosse ball work.  _Vastus Lateralis (both)_ tender, _Glut Med (left)_ very tight and my old friend _QL (left)_ tired.  _Splenius Capitis_ got some work too.

## WEDNESDAY APR 21 ☀️
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**

Commute: 60 minutes easy/back home. *Bring calories! This is a swim/bike brick. And I'm sure you'll be hungry by the end. 
Water front would be great. Just keep it easy. 

### NOTES

So, so sleep but a better start to the day.

### 2100m Swim Workout
Things were going just swimmingly until...  
![Poolside Hazard](/assets/jpg/poolhazard-20210421.jpeg)
I smoked my fifth metacarpal bone on a metal latch of a metal structure protruding into the lane.   That hurt!  I am not normally that close to the edge of the pool but I was giving a slower swimmer some space as she had drifted toward the middle of the lane.  I didn't know it was there until I REALLY knew it was there.

As soon as I could (~4 minutes), I got back to the workout but my hand is still smarting as I type this hours later.

The 6x50 Strong Effort set got this morning's best focus from me (end of the workout, less people remaining).

<!---->
### Easy Waterfront Ride
I think the last time a ride started off feeling like this was when Elliot invited me to a sprint/workout at _Elk Lake_ last August.  It could be described like an atypical fatigue in the legs: **less hurt but still no power**.

I did a modified, counterclockwise loop of the waterfront.  I took my time and sucked down a 220 calorie bottle of lemonade.  I purposefully missed the hill on _Sinclair_ but that just put me into the Hills of _Cedar Hill X Road_ and _Blenkinsop_.

## THURSDAY APR 22 ☀️
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 80 minutes: 30 minutes easy spinning. 5x 3:00 uphill (Mill hill area works with me) D 1-5. #1: Ride up, Perfect breathing, EASY effort. #2: Same but 2-5 rpm's faster. #3: Either 1 gear harder, or 10 rpms faster than #1. #4: Strong but controlled effort...think 40k TT effort, #5: Think 20k effort. Take 3 minutes to spin easy/Descend after each. 
20 minutes easy spinning to cool down.

Off the bike: Run 30 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **110 minutes** Happiness: **Yes**

I am glad that I had a FaceTime meeting with my coach before heading out on the ride this afternoon.  It help me reset expectations from how I read the workout vs the objectives needed to be achieved.  With work done, its time to ride.
<!---->
I rode out to _Langford_, then doubled back on _Atkins Road_ few minutes to get to the entry of the _Crystal View Subdivision_.

I rode from the stop sign at the base of the hill, 47m up to a manhole cover at the crest of _Greenmansions Place_.  I did not program the workout into my bike computer; in fact, I didn't even look at it except to push the lap button.  Instead I focused only on perceived effort.

Each trip down the hill was consistently a minute and a half of rest (not 3 minutes).  Each time up was with a bit more intensity, except I blew up midway on the fourth climb and paid for it on the top half.  The 5th time up was paced way better.

### Silverstone Strava Segment
![Strava Segment Chart](/assets/jpg/climb5-20210422.jpeg)
I found this on Strava later tonight.  Red line is my heartrate, blue is their estimated power on the fifth time up the hill tonight.  It looks like I **matched my personal best** of 2:37 going up this hill, set on June 17th last summer.

I **ran well** considering it was pretty close to being right off the bike.  I shouldn't be that surprised though; I did miss a run on [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');).  Basic route to the middle of the _Selkirk Trestle_ in 15 minutes and 30 second negative split (net uphill) on the way back! &nbsp; <small>&mdash; 5.33 km @5:33/km pace</small>

## FRIDAY APR 23 ⛅️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.

Run 30 minutes. EASY. Flat route. Not hard in the slightest.

3:30pm: Swim 2100: 
3 rounds (100 easy free, 4x 25 kick D 1-4 r :10)
600 continuous/steady w/ nice kicking rhythm. 
2x 25 Super easy. 
6x 125 Steady/Strong focus (aka: Stronger turnover and higher form focus than usual) R :30. 
4x 25 super easy to cool down. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2100m**

Thankful that today's swim workout was easy to remember as I couldn't get it to sync with my watch.  It was a nice change as I used the clock(s) on the wall to monitor my rest times.  One thing not measured was the kick lengths so the activity shows 1800m of "swimming".
<!---->
The warmup felt like should.  I was stiff through the shoulders initially but it didn't last all that long.  The 600m was paced appropriately and I was digging a little bit deeper on the 6x125 set.  1:42/100m to wrap things up after a _longer_ break after the last 125m effort.

![Swim Pace Chart](/assets/jpg/swim-20210423.jpeg)
Effort and focus were **on point** at the pool this afternoon.  I bested my previous 400m PR from Feb 29, 2020 by 22 seconds without trying.

---

The run was a relaxed pace a little while after dinner.  Same 5km route as [yesterday](javascript:flick('thu');) but a notch slower.  30 minutes, evenly split to the _Selkirk Trestle_ and back.  It was noticeably cooler tonight and the 13 day run on sunny weather has ended.
