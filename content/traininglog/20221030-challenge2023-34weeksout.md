In between periods of heavy rain and before the Seahawks game, I got 40 minutes of continuous running in.  I felt comfortable and ran mostly on the dirt of the _Colquitz River Trail_.   Walking time was a little over 10 minutes.  I had a good stretch afterwards, during the game.

Drove to the pool after work; the pool was quiet (kids had other plans).

I pushed a bit harder on 10x100 set.  Started with a 1:41 and watched the fade to 1:47 for the later reps.  Finished strong with another 1:41 on the final 100.  All touch turns and my back is feeling good (not perfect).

Carved a [pumpkin](javascript:flkty.select(2);) once I got home.

Time and work didn't allow for the opportunity to right in nice weather; on the trainer after dinner.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

3x 200 aerobic/steady/smooth. R :45 after each. 
2x 50 super easy to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **46 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **1900m**

Miserable, cold, wet weather for the ride to and from the pool.  I was going toget wet anyway...

Swam with the 50m lanes in place.  It wasn't that big of a deal as it used to be (mentally it used to feel like forever to get to the far wall).  I did my best to get the descending sets in.  After 1900m, I considered doing a few more lengths but decided to stick to the plan and pedalled home instead.
