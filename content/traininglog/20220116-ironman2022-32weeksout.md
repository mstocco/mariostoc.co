# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, January 16, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**32** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Keep building the cake.

## SUMMARY
Total SBR Time: **8 Hours**

I feel like I was **ADDING TO THE CAKE**

I traded a bit of time for a bit of intensity, specifically with the finish to the run on [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');).  By the end of the week, I did feel a bit of the niggles coming into the picture.

This week had more chaos on the work-front but I was able to absorb it at the expense of some mobility and a walk.

The weather was mostly clear (but below seasonal) too.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 20 minutes nice and easy to start the day.

Run 60 minutes w/ your buddies. Generally an easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **9.0 km**

Shoulder is a bit sore from the jab but not as sore as I remember from the shots last summer.

I ran with Yauki and Vince this afternoon, so pace was higher for the bulk of the run.  After the hill on _Lampson_, the group pace was around 5:30/km and I felt like I was working to match the other two.

Like [last week](ironman2022-33weeksout?tue), from _Harbour Road_ the pace slowly crept up through to the _Selkirk Trestle_ and from there, the pace built again.

A cyclist commented, "you guys are fast!" as she looked for room to pass the group.  Another cyclist up the road was the last person I past before breaking into a 60m stride to finish at _Kelvin Road_ and an even 9 km for the day.

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes**

I was expecting to feel more beat up from the run yesterday.  I woke up **feeling good** physically.  There is work stress to get through.

I (mistakenly) plugged in an extra 5:00 interval into my bike computer and then while I was riding, was surprised when it the unit beeped and said, _"Go one more."_  I pedalled that extra rep.  When I got off the bike and went for a late dinner.

Mobility was missed; it was getting late.

Must have been a good sleep as I was awake before the 0500 alarm and feeling refreshed.

My shoulder felt good enough to go.  

I drove to the pool as I needed to be working right after the swim.
<!---->
I messed up the recording of the workout by pushing off from the wall without starting the watch.  Once I got myself back on track, I lost count of the 100m reps when I had to move to a different swim lane (Thursday swim club).  Of the 100m set that I completed, I was not challenged physically but it was **not easy** to say what was 1/2 IM pace vs 750m pace.  Kind of like why we don't have 7-speed cassettes on our bikes any longer; more gears the better.

Good news in that I was able to get through some of the chaos from the work week today.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

In bed earlier but up after midnight because I was hungry; ate a couple slices of banana bread that Carina made and fell back asleep.

The short time on the rollers was lighter effort and **felt great**.

The run later in the afternoon was a forty-plus minute opportunity to tune out work and the week that was; nice **easy effort**.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
MTB ~ 1:45 - 2:00. 
Base miles. Fuel up. Stay hydrated. Stay warm. Have fun.

Walk 20-30 minutes

### NOTES
MTB Moving Time: **99 Minutes**

Weather was sunny but cool(er).  Carina and I pedalled to _The Nest_ for a latte.  I pressed start on the ride after that and headed up the hill.

Unlike [last Saturday](ironman2022-3weeksout?sat), I decided to veer off the fire road and take on some single track.  I hadn't ridden on a proper MTB trial since November and there was some rust.  I rode _"Comfy Wooden Chair"_ first (very familiar to me) before making my way to  _"Electric Avenue"_ (ridden once last year).  This let me explore and ride _"Electric Light"_ back into _Thetis Regional Park_.
<!---->

### A fun ride but...
I noticed a pretty acute twinge in my left ankle that seemed to go away after an hour.

On _Electric Ave_, I started to find a groove with the trail but my current fitness was a limiter.

I went over the handlebars, embarrassingly, on a feature that was not (should not be) challenging for me.  That left a pretty descent bruise on my **left vastus medialis** that I felt for the rest of the ride and into the rest of the evening (it is sore).
