I had to renew the insurance for my SUV so I walked to the broker (11 minutes).  From there, I jogged easy on the _Goose_ for 30 minutes.  The legs felt **surprisingly good** although a sore piriformis, turning into sciatica, was felt on the 5 minute walk home.
<!----->
The weather was warm with a building wind from the north. Maybe it was the heat, or the wind but I wasn't in the mood for more activity.  I had a nap early in the afternoon; unknown how long.

Around 1530, Carina and I headed up to _Shawnigan Lake_ where got the swim workout done.  No wetsuit and the water was a cool, near perfect temperature.  I had a **good groove** going and the only thing that put a delta into my distance per 10 minutes was the boat wake.

The RCMP pulled over the boat causing the greatest waves and when that happened, my last 10 minutes was as long and easy as my first.

Slept solid through 0313 then whatever woke me had me awake for about an hour.  My sciatica has calmed a bit but my hips/lumbar are tight.

During the heat of the day, Yauki and Vince accompanied me for the planned workout (as written). I consumed 2 Maurten gels, one after 12 minutes into the run, the second around 38 minutes.  500ml of water was mostly drank on the run; finished on the walk home.

Apart from the first bit, I **felt good** this afternoon.

Another restful sleep last night.  The soreness in my right piriformis seems to have cleared but my lumbar/hips are again stiff this morning.

After a busy day at work and needing to run a few errands, I drove to the pool.  Once in the water, I **felt really good** from the first stroke.
<!----->
First of the descending set came in at 1:46 and I thought I'd struggle to make each rep faster; it was a bit of effort but no struggle.  During the 9th rep of the next set of 100m lengths, I thought it was my 11th (last hard rep) and I put put my best sprint into the last 25m.  That knocked a second off my **100m PR** (25m pool, touch turns) which is now 1:31.

Before dinner, I set the rollers up outside in the sunshine and pedalled easy for 48 minutes.  I was dripping with sweat; perfect.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
In honor of all the climbing the previous [Wednesday](ironman2022-4weeksout?wed), and the huge ride on [Saturday](ironman2022-4weeksout?sat), and the longest run in a while on [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');)...  This ride should be flatter! Time in the bars getting comfy.

Ride 3:00. Peninsula loop is perfect. Get your aerobar time, get in your groove. 
Fuel, hydrate, get comfy. Then see how you feel off the bike. 
Never too hard on this ride. Riding efficiently and covering ground as easily/smoothly as possible. 

Off the Bike: 30 minutes. Easy running. Finding your footing on some tired legs.

### NOTES
Total Time: **198 Mins** &nbsp;Ride: **71 km** &nbsp;Run: **5.3 km**

Another solid sleep and I woke feeling refreshed.

Hips are less tight this morning and the soreness in my piriformis seems to have cleared.
<!----->
Like [last Wednesday](ironman2022-4weeksout?wed), the weather was dreary and **motivation was low**.  I clipped into a pedal but before I took a stroke, I toppled over.  I must really not want to ride today.  The paving stones of my driveway left a nice raspberry on my left knee.  I picked my sorry self up and pedalled away; time to just get it done.

<!----->
~9 minutes in, on _Douglas Street_, I got into the aero bars and once again, riding was fun.  I rode the a very typical _"Lochside Route"_ north through to _Sidney_, turning around at _Dolphin Road_ near the ferry terminal.  Effort was steady and I had plenty of time in the aero bars throughout the ride.  A bit of a SE breeze pushed me north and the wind all but died for the trip south.  Ironically, it was colder the further north on the peninsula than it was in _Saanich_.

Roughly 1.8L of water and ~90 of Maynards (Tropical Swedish Berries) consumed on the bike.

---

I set out on for the run in short order.  My energy was there and my **legs felt good** however...

The uncomfortable nervy sensation in my little toe was felt the entire jog (_Quadra Street_ and back).  At the _Switch Bridge_, I stopped briefly to re-tie my left shoe; that didn't help.  The bone may have healed but I may be dealing with a nerve issue for the foreseeable future.

Open Water 55 minutes in the water: 
5x 3 minutes easy swimming to warm up and find your rhythm. R 1:00 after each.

### NOTES
Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp;Ride: **14 km** &nbsp;Swim: **2300	m**

Slept soundly and feel pretty good after some cereal and a coffee.

Cooler temperature had less people at the lake this afternoon; felt at times like I had the place to myself.  Pretty standard workout with no wetsuit and towing a float bag.  Most people swim around the islands of the lake.  I prefer sighting the longest, straightest line that I can.
