I had to renew the insurance for my SUV so I walked to the broker (11 minutes).  From there, I jogged easy on the _Goose_ for 30 minutes.  The legs felt **surprisingly good** although a sore piriformis, turning into sciatica, was felt on the 5 minute walk home.
<!----->
The weather was warm with a building wind from the north. Maybe it was the heat, or the wind but I wasn't in the mood for more activity.  I had a nap early in the afternoon; unknown how long.

Around 1530, Carina and I headed up to _Shawnigan Lake_ where got the swim workout done.  No wetsuit and the water was a cool, near perfect temperature.  I had a **good groove** going and the only thing that put a delta into my distance per 10 minutes was the boat wake.

The RCMP pulled over the boat causing the greatest waves and when that happened, my last 10 minutes was as long and easy as my first.

Slept solid through 0313 then whatever woke me had me awake for about an hour.  My sciatica has calmed a bit but my hips/lumbar are tight.

During the heat of the day, Yauki and Vince accompanied me for the planned workout (as written). I consumed 2 Maurten gels, one after 12 minutes into the run, the second around 38 minutes.  500ml of water was mostly drank on the run; finished on the walk home.

I **felt good** this afternoon.
