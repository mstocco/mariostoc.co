### PLANNED WORKOUT
90 minute Run/Walk:

10 minutes walking to finish up.

Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **82 Mins** &nbsp; Old Man Shuffle: **10.5 km**

Tired legs is an **understatement**.  This one hurt in a couple of ways.

Ran on gravel with my soft Altras and my pinkie toe did not agree with the surface.  My legs were super heavy and never loosened up.  What really hurt the most was my ego;  I fought for about 28 minutes up to _Mann Road_ but after a quick bio-break in the bushes, found it really hard to shuffle again.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Big Swim: Open Water
2x 3 minutes EASY to warm up and get loose. Rest as needed after each. These are to stretch out and get comfortable. 
4x 15 minutes continuous/steady. Swim straight. Breathe. Have fun. Find your sustainable rhythm. Something that seems reasonable for 3800 meters. 
Rest 3 minutes between each. 
3 minutes easy swimming to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **84 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **~3500m**

Durrance Lake with just a trisuit (no neoprene).

I felt good; swimming doesn't ask a lot from my legs though, during the 3rd 15 minute rep, I felt a bit of a cramp in my left hip flexor.  Water was nice and I had Carina on her paddle board, checking in with me as I swam laps of the lake.

Weather is still sunny but it has turned cold (for August).

I rode my TT Bike up to _Hamsterly Beach_ to pick up the race swag (hoodie) that was not available for the Victoria Half.  It was roughly 30 minutes to and about the same coming home.

I did not run immediately when I got home but when I did eventually head out, it felt like a _"brick session"_; heavy legs (again) for almost the full half hour.
