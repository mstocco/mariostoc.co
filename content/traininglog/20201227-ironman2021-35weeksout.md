### NOTES

Last night's sleep was ok; I woke feeling rested but **stiff and sore**.

The weather was blah; not rainy but dreary nonetheless.  I went into the garage and looked at all the work that I did yesterday and realized that there was one more project.  

Last year, I built a fork stand for the rollers; it didn't work as well as I would have liked.  The unit would _"walk"_ and after a while, I'd be pedalling with a handlebar pointing either left or right.  Today, I put some time into building a better rig.

### REBUILT THE FORK STAND (TRAINER)

The scheduled ride's intent was nice and steady and with a new indoor rig to test out, I pedalled steady for an hour and fifty.  I sipped a 750ml bottle of lemonade (~200 cals).  I had Tabot Cox' _2019 Kona Series Compilation_ on the screen and the Seahawks _Post Game Show_ on the radio.
