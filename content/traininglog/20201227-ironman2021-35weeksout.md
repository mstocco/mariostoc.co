# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, December 27, 2020](javascript:flick('sun');)

**35 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Last week of 2020 and this week needs to be consistent (don't they all).

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **HIT BY A TRUCK** but I healed then carried on.

When I look back on how unusually stiff and sore I was on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) and then how that carried over to [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');) I wasn't listening.  [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');) was a message that was **loud and clear**; my capacity for stress was beyond it's limit.

It wasn't a bump in training volume or intensity but the culmination of an emotionally heavy Christmas season.

Although this week didn't go to plan, I was able to get +9 hours of training in and to me that is a small win.

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:00 on MTB. Great Trail or the Goose. Keep it nice and steady. Cover some ground! Stay well hydrated, fueled, and warm!   
OTB: Run 40 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **150 minutes**

Last night's sleep was ok; I woke feeling rested but man, my posterior is **stiff and sore**.

The weather was blah; not rainy but dreary nonetheless.  I went into the garage and looked at all the work that I did yesterday and realized that there was one more project.  

Last year, I built a fork stand for the rollers; it didn't work as well as I would have liked.  The unit would _"walk"_ and after a while, I'd be pedalling with a handlebar pointing either left or right.  Today, I put some time into building a better rig.

### REBUILT THE FORK STAND (TRAINER)

The scheduled ride's intent was nice and steady and with a new indoor rig to test out, I pedalled steady for an hour and fifty.  I sipped a 750ml bottle of lemonade (~200 cals).  I had Tabot Cox' _2019 Kona Series Compilation_ on the screen and the Seahawks _Post Game Show_ on the radio.  

Very sore glutes and adductors for the easy run.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Total Moving Time: **33 minutes**

Another okay sleep last night but I am again, very stiff and very sore.  Like yesterday, this is mostly in the glutes and adductors but today I can feel it in the lumbar and hamstrings too.

I jogged easy down to [Curtis Point](javascript:flkty.select(2);) to catch the sunset.  I continued on but stopped after the short hill up to _Harriet Road_ because I thought I had a rock in my shoe; nothing was in the shoe or sock though.

I can still feel that bit of pain on the bottom of my foot an hour after getting home.  Thankfully I don't run for another couple days.

What happens when I don't read the tea leaves.

Today was a no go with a headache so bad that I was bordering on vomiting.  4 Advil over the course of the day and the headache only began to get better by dinner time.

Ride 60 minutes easy. Inside/outside. Trainer/rollers. Up to you. Keep it easy!   
Run 30 minutes flat and EASY.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

So I did sleep better last night and that headache is gone but given how terrible I felt [yesterday](javascript:flick('tue');), I am taking today off training too.  That sensation of a rock in my shoe is still there too, even though I am in the house barefoot.

Elliot sent me an email letting me know about this race at the end of May:

Of course I signed up!  Hopefully this happens.

## THURSDAY DEC 31 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 75 minutes. Hilly route. Easy effort. 
Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 minutes**

Mea culpa:  I thought today was Friday so I was on the trainer for 80 minutes of easy spinning.

In all fairness though, I would have looked to give my plantar another day without running just to be safe.  I am ok with pushing through tender soleus pain because I am generally confident in the outcome of running with that type of tenderness.  

What started from the run on [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');) and persisted through yesterday was closer to a localized burning sensation.

## SATURDAY JAN 02 üåß
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:15 on MTB. Ideally on the Goose or the Great Trail. Easy to steady effort. Stay well fueled. Bundle up for the inevitable showers. 
Off the bike (but feel free to take time to get warm if needed)   
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort

### NOTES
Total Time: **165 minutes**

_"Bundle up for the inevitable showers..."_   It rained so hard, the sky's so dark that we had the lights on in the house this afternoon.  I bailed on the MTB ride.  In its place, I pedalled the TT bike on the trainer for 2:15.  Instead of just pedalling aimlessly, I made this a bit more fun.

Earlier this week, I took a write up on the IRONMAN Canada bike course and plugged in the points of interest into a Garmin Bike Workout at a condensed rate.  For example the first point of interest in the write up is reaching _Skaha Lake_ 6 km from _T1_ which I plugging into Garman as 0.6 km.  Rinse/repeat until I had a total of 18 kms.  I rode those a constant speed last [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) and finally today, I took the time splits and multiplied each one by five giving me a 3 hours worth of segments and beeps from my bike computer; each beep represents a point of interest from that original write up.

The fifth beep put me at the foot of _"Richter Pass"_ at an hour and seventeen minutes in; after and hour and fifty-three minutes, the bike computer let me know I was at _Keremeos_ and _HWY 3A_.  Anyway, this was a novel attempt to add some contextual fun into an indoor ride.

I ran out of lemonade so I had a can of ginger ale and snacked on ju-jubes.
