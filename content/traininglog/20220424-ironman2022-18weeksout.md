# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, April 24, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**18** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Race well, recover well, get back after it!

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **10.5 Hours** <small>race week reduced</small>

I feel like I was **REWARDED**

The saying _"hard work pays off"_ has meaning for some but I'd rather phrase it as _"consistent work pays off."_  

Looking back at the days I didn't want to go to the pool at o'dark-hundred, all the Tuesdays when I struggled to keep up running with Yauki and Vince, they all mattered this week.

The big tell is not a PR in the 10km @50 years old, it was that I wasn't shattered by the effort.

Not fooling myself, I did feel some fatigue on Tuesday but overall, I am in a really good spot in the journey.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
RACE DAY!

Pre-Race: 8 minute morning mobility
 
With plenty of clothes on....Walk 10-15 minutes. Literally a walk. Get the core body temperature up a bit.  Make sure you are well hydrated and fueled. Have water and some calories on hand.

Jog 5 minutes easy.

10k Race:   
First 1k on the much easier than race pace side. 
Second k just a touch easier than race pace. 
2k-10k: Have at it.
 
Post race: Grab some liquids and some calories. Put on a jacket. Walk 15 minutes. 

Pm: Mobility 18 minutes

### NOTES
Chip Time: **46:39** &nbsp; Run: **10 km**  &nbsp; üèÜ

In the scurrying around in the morning, I missed the morning mobility, had a cup of coffee, toast with peanut butter and that's it.

Once parked downtown, Carina and I walked to the event (2 km) and I got in a 6 minute jog before the race.

The race pretty much went to plan.  Maybe too well.  I seeded myself in the 50-59 minute group and that forced me to be slow for the first 2 km.  As space opened up, I found a comfortable rhythm and held it for about the next half hour.

Passing the Terry Fox memorial (6.7km) is were the race started for me mentally.  There is a downhill from 7 to 8 km where I focused on making some time and at the 8k flag I promised myself to _"do something special for the next kilometre"_.  At the 9k flag, I was carrying that momentum and I made anothe promise, _"make this next one even more special"_.

<div style="height:26px;"></div>
I noticed that I was starting to breath hard with 400m to go and after the final turn with 300m to go, I just did a long stride to finish.

### New Personal Best.
I took 38 seconds off my previous best 10k (January 2020) and almost 4 minutes off my previous best on this course (April 2019).

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Sleep in!

Swim 2000: 
4 rounds (100 easy swim r :15, 50 swim w/ buoy r :15) 
4 rounds (100 easy swim r :15, 50 steady kick r :15)

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2000m**

Not sure was has given me more confidence.  The run [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');) or the swim this afternoon.

Maybe it was mentally the fact that it was just 2000m, maybe it was because the pool was 25m long, or even maybe it was because this was a mid afternoon swim.  Regardless I felt strong and connected with the water today.

Sleep **1** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 50-60 minutes EASY w/ buddies. I'd prefer 50 minutes. Certainly no more than 60 minutes. 
Please keep the route on the flat side. And the pace on the easy side.

Rollers ~ 30 mins post-run spin to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **77 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **8 km**

Maybe the **best sleep** ever (or at least in recent time).  Out before 2030, up at 0530.

At 1600, Yauki was at my door and ready to go.  We met up with Vince and walked for the first ~10 minutes before starting with an easy pace.  The numbers crept up over the next bit and at 7 km, I headed for home and the boys continued for another 3 more kilometres.

**Easy spin** with the TT Bike on the rollers afterwards.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Easy spin to pool.  
Swim 2800: 
3x 100 easy free to warm up. Rest as needed.

4x 400 @ 1/2 IM effort/focus. R 1:30 between each. 
4x 50 super easy to stretch out and cool down. 

Ride 60 minutes on the way home. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2800m**

0500 was a groggy time to get up and the sleep didn't feel like [yesterday](javascript:flick('tue');).  I'd make up for it with a nap after work though.  My lumbar was stiff this morning too.

The 4x400m were work.  There was lane congestion this morning; some extra surges to get around people were needed.
<!---->
All good practice and I was happy with my effort and happy that my times were very consistent for each of the 400m reps

Not so happy with the actual times (looking at the activity later).  To be fair to myself, I was focused on effort and form in the pool, not on the time of each rep.

---

On the bike, I felt the harder effort of the swim.  I could feel tightness in my lumbar coming on too so I didn't ride the full hour.

It is still pretty cool in the mornings but the wind was lighter and I was bundled up appropriately.

I carried 80g of lemonade/maltodextrin mix in a 750ml bottle but maybe consumed a third before getting back home.

## THURSDAY APR 28 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **5** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:40 on TT bike. 
Generally a flatter ride But.....
Pick out a 3-4 minute climb (Up to you) 
And get in 4 reps head uphill. 
These aren't "hard" but they should be a bit harder than your normal flat riding. Controlled uphill riding. 
Easy spin down after each. 
Just getting into the rhythm of how it feels to climb on the TT bike. 
On the flatter sections....try to get in 20-30 minutes of time in the bars. 
Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **98 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **37 km**

After work it was the TT Bike on _Mckenzie Ave_ to _UVic_ for reps up _Cadboro Bay Road_.  I think I rode this to plan and I felt good riding steady uphill and in the aero bars later on.  Motivation to get out the door earlier was the hard part.

Light SE breeze meant practice getting blown around while descending into Cadboro Bay.

Time: **120 Minutes** &nbsp;Swim: **2600m** &nbsp;Run: **6 km**

Just an ok sleep and lumbar felt ok this morning.

The swim started with fatigue in my triceps during the 300m and I was into a groove after that.  Midway through the 12x100m set, things started to drag and I had to press through to the end of the workout.

This was a _"got it done"_ swim.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:00 on TT bike. Flat to rolling terrain.
Another ride, with some time in the bars.
Generally speaking, this should be an easy ride.
 
Mobility 25 minutes.  
**Hydrate and fuel well this evening.**

### NOTES
Total Time: **105 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **indoor trainer**

Wet morning and commitments in the afternoon had me set up the TT Bike on the trainer.

I loaded this [IM Canada video](https://youtu.be/jbDaIGw-TYQ) on the screen and put on _"The Peter Attia Drive Podcast"_,  [Episode 199](https://peterattiamd.com/ryanhall/) with Ryan Hall.

Lots of time in the aero bars learning what muscles fatigues first; anything that I might miss on a real ride where my focus is on the road.  Hopefully the results of the experiment are fruitful.
<!---->
The first burn I could feel was in my left gluteus minimus and both left and right adductors.  My left lumbar followed after 45 minutes of steady pressure on the pedals and I finally sat up after 53 minutes (top of Richter Pass on the video).  I was back down in the aero position before the top of the hour, continuing to pedal stead through 75 minutes.

From that point, loosely followed the bike workout from [March 17th](ironman2022-24weeksout?thu) starting with the cadence reps and getting 2 of the 4 minute efforts in.  No comparison to be drawn between the workout in March and today, one was done on rollers, today I had the trainer configuration and the TT bike.

Funny enough, the ache in my lumbar no longer noticed at the end of the ride. 

I had one bottle with 90g of lemonade and one bottle of plain water with me for the workout.  Might have got through half of each bottle and learned that working when more horizontal means a greater chance fluid in the gut trying to come back up.
