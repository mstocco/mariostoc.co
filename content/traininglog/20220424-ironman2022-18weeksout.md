### PLANNED WORKOUT
RACE DAY!

Pre-Race: 8 minute morning mobility
 
With plenty of clothes on....Walk 10-15 minutes. Literally a walk. Get the core body temperature up a bit.  Make sure you are well hydrated and fueled. Have water and some calories on hand.

Jog 5 minutes easy.

10k Race:   
First 1k on the much easier than race pace side. 
Second k just a touch easier than race pace. 
2k-10k: Have at it.
 
Post race: Grab some liquids and some calories. Put on a jacket. Walk 15 minutes. 

Pm: Mobility 18 minutes

### NOTES
Chip Time: **46:39** &nbsp; Run: **10 km**

In the scurrying around in the morning, I missed the morning mobility, had a cup of coffee, toast with peanut butter and that's it.

Once parked downtown, Carina and I walked to the event (2 km) and I got in a 6 minute jog before the race.

The race pretty much went to plan.  Maybe too well.  I seeded myself in the 50-59 minute group and that forced me to be slow for the first 2 km.  As space opened up, I found a comfortable rhythm and held it for about the next half hour.

Passing the Terry Fox memorial (6.7km) is were the race started for me mentally.  There is a downhill from 7 to 8 km where I focused on making some time and at the 8k flag I promised myself to _"do something special for the next kilometre"_.  At the 9k flag, I was carrying that momentum and I made anothe promise, _"make this next one even more special"_.

I noticed that I was starting to breath hard with 400m to go and after the final turn with 300m to go, I just did a long stride to finish.

### New Personal Best.
I took 38 seconds off my previous best 10k (January 2020) and almost 4 minutes off my previous best on this course (April 2019).

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2000m**

Not sure was has given me more confidence.  The run [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');) or the swim this afternoon.

Maybe it was mentally the fact that it was just 2000m, maybe it was because the pool was 25m long, or even maybe it was because this was a mid afternoon swim.  Regardless I felt strong and connected with the water today.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2800m**

0500 was a groggy time to get up and the sleep didn't feel like [yesterday](javascript:flick('tue');).  I'd make up for it with a nap after work though.  My lumbar was stiff this morning too.

The 4x400m were work.  There was lane congestion this morning; some extra surges to get around people were needed.
<!---->
All good practice and I was happy with my effort.

---

On the bike, I felt like I swam hard and I could feel the tightness in my lumbar coming on.  I didn't ride the full hour.  It is still pretty cool in the mornings.  I had 80g of lemonade/maltodextrin mix in a 750ml bottle but maybe consumed a third before getting back home.
