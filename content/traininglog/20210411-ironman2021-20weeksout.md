# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, April 11, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**20 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
With the bathroom reno in flight, I am going to have to be diligent with time management this week.  It looks like this is going to be the first week of real spring weather too.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...  
<sup>(completed at the end of the week)</sup>
<!--OVERTRAINING|ON THE EDGE|STAYING CONSISTENT|LAGGING A BIT-->


<!---->
## SUNDAY APR 11 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.

1st: 55 minutes: 5 minutes walking to warm up. Run 45 minutes. Flat to rolling terrain. Easy effort. Followed by 5 minutes of walking.

2nd: Ride 90 minutes. FLAT terrain. Ideally on the road bike (to keep it easier) Spinning the legs out after the morning run. (Can be anytime of day)

### NOTES
Total Time: **113 minutes**

I spent +3 hours chipping away at mortar and slate tiles before heading out for the run.

**My legs felt heavy**, particularly going uphill.  Up and over Craigflower Hill and then rolling terrain until I got back to my neighbourhood.  There was a bit of downhill on McKenzie Avenue which seem to "wake" my legs up a bit.
<!---->
The 90 minute easy ride was 24 minutes short but had a **bit more effort** on the crank to make up the difference.  I pedalled a mostly flat route to Sidney to meet Carina who was already up there.  At the _McTavish Interchange_, I hopped onto the shouder of the _Pat Bay Highway_ and held 35kph until _Bevan Avenue_ in _Sidney_.  My legs did not feel fresh and there was a light, NNE headwind.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Short commute to the pool.  
5:30am: Swim 2200:

### NOTES
Total Time: **110 minutes** &nbsp; Swim Distance: **2050m**

A bit short on time this morning meant missing the 3x50 Strong set; regardless I was feeling **pretty cooked** from the effort this morning.

The final 100m was done with a lane all to myself; Even though I nailed the flip turn and held a comfortable effort, I was still a bit behind schedule, touching the wall in 1:48.

The commute was with the road bike this morning and it was 10 minutes to the pool (stopping for traffic lights) and 40 minutes of easy pedaling along _Dallas Road_, through _Downtown_ and back on the _Goose_.

Before the run [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');), I had a can of Redbull.  I swear that had an effect on my sleep as I am normally _"lights out"_ when my head hits the pillow.  That didn't happen last night.

## TUESDAY APR 13 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.  
Run/Walk 85 minutes: 5 minutes easy walking to warm up. Run 75 minutes. Feel free to do a rolling route. No need to search for big climbs, but you have to run more than pancake routes. Bring a gel! Maybe some water as well. 5 minutes walking to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **78 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12.5 km**

Ok sleep last night but I wasn't so eager to get the run in before breakfast.  After work is when I put on my run kit.  I did the Hip Mobility Routine V2 right before heading out too.

A gel was replaced with about 100 calories of lemonade in bottle.  Used an old water bottle carrier only to be reminded why it is an _"old"_ water bottle carrier.  I also ran in my new pair of Altra Escalante 2.5 for the first time; nice update.
<!---->
Running this afternoon felt heavy legged to start, really good after 45 minutes and then heavy legged to wrap up.  It was warm too.

There was a hint that my left ankle might still be a bit bothered from a mountain bike ride [10 days ago](ironman2021-22weeksout?sat); a couple of mild twinges in the first couple of kms but all clear for the remaining 10 km.

My run clock must be off because after that 45 minute mark, I swear I was popping of the ground at 5:35/km pace but the GPS/footpod was measuring **closer to 6:05/km**.  I really don't care either way, the goal was to run a rolling route and this checked that box nicely ‚òëÔ∏è

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Short commute to the pool.   
5:30am: Swim 2200:

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 minutes** &nbsp; Swim Distance: **2200m**

Not the best sleep last night, up at 0115, 0200, 0430 and finally 0500.

Walking to the garage, I noticed that 0520 is now about the start of dawn with light beginning in the eastern sky.  Riding to the pool just last week meant this time of the day was pitch black.  The birds were in full song too!  What an absolutely wonderful way to start a Wednesday.

I was still pretty crisp temperature wise though.
<!---->
The first 100m in the pool was less than comfortable but once warmed up, things started to click.  I swam in the _Continuous Lane_ with only minor lane congestion.  Nothing out of the ordinary to report except that my focus and effort was on point this morning.

I walked to the showers with a bit of a pump going on; nice!

### Swim Pacing
![Swim Pace Graph](/assets/jpg/swim-20210414.jpeg)

The air temperature on the ride home had warmed up to 39	¬∞F; looks like another gorgeous spring day.

---

I must say that the combination of reno-work and training is starting to be felt.  I am stiff through my neck, shoulders and arms.  I probably need another evening to finish prepping the floor for new tile.  I'll have some drywall to remove after that and the rest will be mostly done by the pros.

## THURSDAY APR 15 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.  
Ride 70 minutes. Road bike. Purposely head to a few climbs. Ride up them under control, but you have the all clear to put a bit of pressure in the pedals and get the HR up. You are surrounded by short punch climbs. I'm not expecting you (or want you) to do the same climb all ride, but it would be nice if you got in 3-5 1-3 minute climbs. Just enough so you finish the ride feeling like you get your legs pumping a bit. (Feel free to shoot me a route if you have questions) 

Off the bike: Run 30 minutes. Easy effort. Run with the best form you have!

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 minutes** &nbsp; Hills Climbed: **4**

I woke congested (nasal) and with a bit of a headache.  [Yesterday](javascript:flick('wed');), I cut the grass and worked on the reno with just a dust mask. 
<!---->
I did have intentions on riding before dawn (like yesterday) but my body said no.

### RIDE NOTES
I noticed that I have hill repeats on the bike next week up _Mill Hill_ so I set off to explore something new for today.  I ended up on _Haida Drive_ in the _Braemar Heights_ subdivision of _Langford_.  3 times up that plus the hill on _Veterans Memorial Parkway_ checked off the requisite hill efforts (4) for the scheduled ride.   With more fitness, there are more hills to explore here.  _Fulton Road_ looked to be longer and steeper but would need to be timed for a low traffic period.   I rode a bit longer as this subdivision is a bit further away (90 minutes).

Almost 2 bottles of water and 200 calories consumed.  It was nice to finally be riding in summer kit.

### RUN NOTES
There was **no juice** in the legs.  Short jog to the _Selkirk Trestle_; turned around at about 14 minutes and made it back to my start point (net uphill) with a negative split.

## FRIDAY APR 16 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 30 minutes. EASY running. Nice short run whenever you have time.

5:30pm: Swim 2000: 
4 rounds (50 easy free, 50 w/ 2x Picking head up to sight per 25 r :20, 2x 25 Strong but very controlled kick (aka: Maintainable for at least 200) r :15)
25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200 steady trying to find your rhythm in the water. R :20 after each. 16x 25 Kick D 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 From easy to strong. r :10. 100 easy swimming to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **29 minutes**

Up at 0500 but went back to bed for more üí§.   Neck is is still a bit stiff but my arms and shoulders less so this morning.

I had an errand (pick up filters for my respirator) so I incorporated that into today's easy run.  
<!---->
### Run Notes
The route was essentially my _Selkirk Trestle_ out and back, except for a small detour to go to a supply store.  I hit _pause_ going into store and _resume_ when leaving.  Moving time was 29:35; time in the store was 5:03.

Unlike [yesterday](javascript:flick('thu');), I was **popping off the ground** this afternoon and averaged 5:35/km on the way back home.  No aches, pains or abundance of fatigue to report.

It was a warmer than usual afternoon; 22¬∞C and no breeze even at the water's edge; regardless this short run felt effortless.
<!---->
### Swim Notes

This swim felt like I had a run about 90 minutes prior.  That long kick set did work the hips but was enough of a rest to crank out the following:
