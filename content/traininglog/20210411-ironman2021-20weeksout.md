Week beginning [Sunday, April 11, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**20 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
With the bathroom reno in flight, I am going to have to be diligent with time management this week.  It looks like this is going to be the first week of real spring weather too.

## SUMMARY

## SUNDAY APR 11 ☀️
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.

1st: 55 minutes: 5 minutes walking to warm up. Run 45 minutes. Flat to rolling terrain. Easy effort. Followed by 5 minutes of walking.

2nd: Ride 90 minutes. FLAT terrain. Ideally on the road bike (to keep it easier) Spinning the legs out after the morning run. (Can be anytime of day)

### NOTES
Total Time: **113 minutes**

I spent +3 hours chipping away at mortar and slate tiles before heading out for the run.

**My legs felt heavy**, particularly going uphill.  Up and over Craigflower Hill and then rolling terrain until I got back to my neighbourhood.  There was a bit of downhill on McKenzie Avenue which seem to "wake" my legs up a bit.

The 90 minute easy ride was 24 minutes short but had a **bit more effort** on the crank to make up the difference.  I pedalled a mostly flat route to Sidney to meet Carina who was already up there.  At the _McTavish Interchange_, I hopped onto the shouder of the _Pat Bay Highway_ and held 35kph until _Bevan Avenue_ in _Sidney_.  My legs did not feel fresh and there was a light, NNE headwind.

### NOTES

A bit short on time this morning meant missing the 3x50 Strong set; regardless I was feeling **pretty cooked** from the effort this morning.

The final 100m was done with a lane all to myself; Even though I nailed the flip turn and held a comfortable effort, I was still a bit behind schedule, touching the wall in 1:48.

The commute was with the road bike this morning and it was 10 minutes to the pool (stopping for traffic lights) and 40 minutes of easy pedaling along _Dallas Road_, through _Downtown_ and back on the _Goose_.

Before the run [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');), I had a can of Redbull.  I swear that had an effect on my sleep as I am normally _"lights out"_ when my head hits the pillow.  That didn't happen last night.

## TUESDAY APR 13 ☀️
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine. 
Run/Walk 85 minutes: 5 minutes easy walking to warm up. Run 75 minutes. Feel free to do a rolling route. No need to search for big climbs, but you have to run more than pancake routes. Bring a gel! Maybe some water as well. 5 minutes walking to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12.5 km**

Ok sleep last night but I wasn't so eager to get the run in before breakfast.  After work, I did the Hip Mobility Routine V2 right before heading out for the run. 

On the run, I felt heavy legged to start, really good after 45 minutes and heavy legged to wrap up.  There was a hint that my left ankle might still be a bit bothered from a mountain bike ride [10 days ago](ironman2021-22weeksout?sat); there were a couple of mild twinges early in the first couple of kms but all clear on the remaining 10 km.

My run clock must be pretty off because I swear I was popping of the ground at 5:30/km pace while the GPS/footpod was measuring 6:00/km.  I really don't care either way, the goal was to run a rolling route and this checked that box nicely ☑️

A gel was replaced with about 100 calories of lemonade in bottle.  Used an old water bottle carrier only to be reminded why it is an _"old"_ water bottle carrier.  I also ran in my new pair of Altra Escalante 2.5 for the first time; nice update.

### NOTES

Not the best sleep last night, up at 0115, 0200, 0430 and finally 0500.

The first 100m in the pool was less than comfortable but once warmed up, things started to click.  I swam in the _Continuous Lane_ with only minor congestion.  Nothing out of the ordinary to report except that my focus and effort was good.  I walked to the showers with a bit of a pump.

The air temperature on the ride home had warmed up to 39	°F; looks like another gorgeous spring day.

## THURSDAY APR 15
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 Routine
Ride 70 minutes. Road bike. Purposely head to a few climbs. Ride up them under control, but you have the all clear to put a bit of pressure in the pedals and get the HR up. You are surrounded by short punch climbs. I'm not expecting you (or want you) to do the same climb all ride, but it would be nice if you got in 3-5 1-3 minute climbs. Just enough so you finish the ride feeling like you get your legs pumping a bit. (Feel free to shoot me a route if you have questions) 

Off the bike: Run 30 minutes. Easy effort. Run with the best form you have!

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**
