# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, February 5, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**20** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Pay attention because I still have a weird cough.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **8.75 Hours**

I feel like I was **STILL COUGHING**

My watch recorded my resting heart rate higher on average this week and its GPS tracking is acting up too.

I looked back on [20 weeks out] from last year and that was a second 13.5 hour week.  Now I can't help but think about how COVID has me behind schedule this year.

Regardless, I did have a couple of wins.  I was back in the pool on [Friday](javascript:flick('fri');) and I had a really solid mountain bike ride on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');).

A low motivation day, all day.

Once I finally got myself out the door and to _Crystal Pool_, 
I found that the pool was closed due to a broken filter.  It 
should be fixed tomorrow.

## MONDAY FEB 6 üå§
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, breathing, glute bridges.  
Ride 75 minutes. Ideally this is outside on the MTB. But a ride on the trainer is certainly ok as well. 

Stretching 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **115 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **147W**

I installed Rouvy on the Apple TV in the suite.  

After a short, 8 minute warmup spin, I rode the simulated 
_Challenge Roth_ bike course from T1, over the hill at Gredding 
and down into the hamlet of Oberm√§ssing.  Easy effort, just 
like it was an Ironman.

I tried Rouvey on my iPad earlier this winter but having it displayed 
on a television is a lot more engaging.

<!----->
### SOME TAKEAWAYS
 * This is not ERG mode.  I am shifting gears with the simulated terrain.
 * If this is correct, I am an 1:18:00 to _Gredding_ and 1:40:00 to the highest point on the course.
 * Lots of very open farmland, if it is windy on race day, there won't be much hiding.
 * The big hill at Gredding starts at 10%, then eases back to 6% for the majority of the climb.
 * In real life, there are 90¬∞ corners on the course where speed will have to be scrubbed. 
 * This was fun and I recognize landmarks from previous race videos on _YouTube_.

Finished work at 1430 but Crystal Pool is still closed due to 
maintenance, lanes at Commonwealth and Esquimalt Rec are filled 
with programs, West Shore has some lanes until 1600 but I won't 
be able to get out there in time.
<!----->
I ran in between rain showers, staying on the bike path to the 
end of the _Selkirk Trestle_.  It crossed my mind to run a bit 
further but my weather window was closing fast.  I picked up the 
pace for the final 5 minutes to get home before the rain. 

The balance of the evening was on the trainer, pedalling _"easish"_ 
and exploring the next 19 kilometres of the Roth bike course.

From _Unterm√§ssing_, it is net uphill going north parallelling the _Autobahn_
and a kicker of a hill before leaving the _Naturpark Altm√ºhltal_ section. 
The road will be fast through _Eys√∂lden_ to the village of _Zell_.

One good thing about today is that my cough is (might be) getting better.

Another so-so sleep.  My best choice to find a lane this afternoon is Westshore (12:15-4PM lanes, water walking & leisure pool).

Bike parts arrived this afternoon and I hung around until they were delivered.  That put me on the back foot for getting out to Westshore for the swim.  So...  the run scheduled for [tomorrow](javascript:flick('fri');) was done today.

Second run in a row where the watch failed to record a GPS track until 20 minutes after pressing start.  Hrmm...

The run was done at an **easy effort** including 5 times up _The Berm_.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, breathing, glute bridges.  
Run 50 minutes. Longest run in a bit.  
EASY effort. A few rollers or longer hills would be great, but not necessary. 

Stretching 27 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2150m**

I felt rested upon rising this morning; its been awhile.  The cough is **more bothersome** today though.

I rode up to the pool in _Colwood_ for my first swim there.  The facility was clean, the water was a bit warm, not a hint of chlorine and a bit salty.  I did have a full lane to myself though.  Drop in fee was a dollar and a bit more than _Crystal Pool_

If this was summer, I couldn't picture myself riding my bike 10 minutes past _Thetis Lake_ just to go for a swim.

I swam the 2000m workout from [](javascript:flick('');).  I thought I'd get a some extra lengths in, but after 150m, honesty trumped ego and I hopped out of the pool.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash;  

### NOTES
Total Time: **160 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **38 km**

Originally, I though I'd avoid the hills and pedal the _Galloping Goose_ out to _Matheson Lake_ and back.  I felt good from the start and chose the hills.

I saw a guy on _Highlands Road_ with a gravel bike who was stopped to fix something.  I asked if he needed help and he said, "Nope, all good" as I rode by him.

Not a minute later, he went flying by me, up and over a hill and I thought about how much extra energy this mountain bike needs.

A couple of corners and another hill and I spot the guy up the road.  Up the next rise, I pull even with him and the truth is now known.  He tries to tell me something but he's blown himself to smithereens.  I pressed on to the park entrance at _Westoby Road_ and never see the guy again.

I made it to the gate in 27:45.  The _Highlands-Barker-Westoby_ segment being 16 seconds slower than [Jan 14th](challenge2023-weeksout?) but still a good ride up the hill.  

I rode by my typical single track trail as through the trees, there looked to be 3 or 4 mountain bikers on the trail.

There is a Strava Segment called _Scafe Hill More Suffering_, turning off _Bellamy Trail_ and going up the fireroad to a lookout point.  In my head, I reminded myself, "Smooth is fast and fast is smooth."  I absolutely smashed my previous times on this climb by **over 3 minutes** set about this time [last year](ironman2022-weeksout?)!

Truth is I was huffing and puffing pretty good.

After a water/gel break, I heading back to _Bellamy Trail_ for a crack at the _Kallie's Korner_ single track.

More good times as this <span style="color:blue;">&#11044; trail</span> had me pushing my bike on many points in the past.  It wasn't clean but I rode way more of the tricky parts then I ever had previously.

_Kallie's Korner_ pops out near the very top of _Munn Road_.  I was hoping to make my way back to _Thetis Park_ via _Frank's Trail_ but at some point, I got turned around and ended up on _Munn_ anyway.  I stopped to look address the "Gees".  A gel, gloves, glasses and my gilet for the cold roll down the hill.

An hour, 38 on the clock, I decided to turn off _Munn_ and make my way to the south end of _Hartland_.  More good riding to and in the park.

I started to feel the ride in my legs on the final kms at _Panama Flats_.  This was a fun ride.
