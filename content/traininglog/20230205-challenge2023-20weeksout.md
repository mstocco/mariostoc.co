### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes** 

Best thing about today is that my cough is (might be) getting better.

Finished work at 1430 but Crystal Pool is still closed due to maintenance, lanes at Commonwealth and Esquimalt Rec are filled with programs, West Shore has some lanes until 1600 but I won't be able to get out there in time.

I ran in between rain showers, staying on the bike path to the end of the _Selkirk Trestle_.  It crossed my mind to run a bit furthers but my weather window was closing fast.  I picked up the pace for the final 5 minutes to get home before the rain. 

The balance of the evening was on the trainer, pedalling easy an exploring the next kilometres of the Roth bike course.
