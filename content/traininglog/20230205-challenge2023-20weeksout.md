A low motivation day, all day.

Once I finally got myself out the door and to _Crystal Pool_, 
I found that the pool was closed due to a broken filter.  It 
should be fixed tomorrow.

## MONDAY FEB 6 ðŸŒ¤

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, breathing, glute bridges.  
Ride 75 minutes. Ideally this is outside on the MTB. But a ride on the trainer is certainly ok as well. 

Stretching 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **115 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **147W**

I installed Rouvy on the Apple TV in the suite.  

After a short, 8 minute warmup spin, I rode the simulated 
_Challenge Roth_ bike course from T1, over the hill at Gredding 
and down into the hamlet of ObermÃ¤ssing.  Easy effort, just 
like it was an Ironman.

I tried Rouvey on my iPad earlier this winter but having it displayed 
on a television is a lot more engaging; recognizing landmarks from 
race videos on YT.

<!----->

#### Some takeaways
 * This is not ERG mode.  I am shifting gears with the simulated terrain.
 * If this is correct, I am an hour, thirty to the highest point on the course.
 * Lots of very open farmland, if it is windy on race day, there won't be much hiding.
 * The big hill at Gredding starts at 10%, then eases back to 6% for the majority.
 * In real life, there are 90Â° corners on the course where speed will have to be scrubbed. 
 * This was fun!

### NOTES
Run Time: **34 Mins** &nbsp; Trainer: **42 Mins** 

Finished work at 1430 but Crystal Pool is still closed due to 
maintenance, lanes at Commonwealth and Esquimalt Rec are filled 
with programs, West Shore has some lanes until 1600 but I won't 
be able to get out there in time.
<!----->
I ran in between rain showers, staying on the bike path to the 
end of the _Selkirk Trestle_.  It crossed my mind to run a bit 
further but my weather window was closing fast.  I picked up the 
pace for the final 5 minutes to get home before the rain. 

The balance of the evening was on the trainer, pedalling _"easish"_ 
and exploring the next 19 kilometres of the Roth bike course.

From _UntermÃ¤ssing_, it is net uphill going north parallelling the _Autobahn_
and a kicker of a hill before leaving the _Naturpark AltmÃ¼hltal_ section. 
The road will be fast through _EysÃ¶lden_ to the village of _Zell_.

One good thing about today is that my cough is (might be) getting better.
