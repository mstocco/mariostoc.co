# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, February 5, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**20** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Pay attention because I still have a weird cough.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **8.75 Hours**

I feel like I was **STILL COUGHING**

My watch recorded my resting heart rate higher on average this 
week and its GPS tracking is acting up too.

I looked back on [20 weeks out](ironman2022-20weeksout) from 
last year and that was the second of two +13 hour weeks.  I 
can't help but think about how COVID has me behind schedule 
this year.

Regardless, I did have a **couple of wins**.  I was back in the 
pool on [Friday](javascript:flick('fri');) and I had a really 
solid mountain bike ride on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');). 

I averaged 77.1 Kg on the scale this week too.

A low motivation day, all day.

Once I finally got myself out the door and to _Crystal Pool_, 
I found that the pool was closed due to a broken filter.  It 
should be fixed tomorrow.

Stretching 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **115 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **147W**

I installed Rouvy on the Apple TV in the suite.  

After a short, 8 minute warmup spin, I rode the simulated 
_Challenge Roth_ bike course from T1, over the hill at Gredding 
and down into the hamlet of Oberm√§ssing.  Easy effort, just 
like it was an Ironman.

I tried Rouvey on my iPad earlier this winter but having it displayed 
on a television is a lot more engaging.

<!----->
### SOME TAKEAWAYS
 * This is not ERG mode.  I am shifting gears with the simulated terrain.
 * If this is correct, I am an 1:18:00 to _Gredding_ and 1:40:00 to the highest point on the course.
 * Lots of very open farmland, if it is windy on race day, there won't be much hiding.
 * The big hill at Gredding starts at 10%, then eases back to 6% for the majority of the climb.
 * In real life, there are 90¬∞ corners on the course where speed will have to be scrubbed. 
 * This was fun and I recognize landmarks from previous race videos on _YouTube_.

### NOTES

Finished work at 1430 but Crystal Pool is still closed due to 
maintenance, lanes at Commonwealth and Esquimalt Rec are filled 
with programs, West Shore has some lanes until 1600 but I won't 
be able to get out there in time.
<!----->
I ran in between rain showers, staying on the bike path to the 
end of the _Selkirk Trestle_.  It crossed my mind to run a bit 
further but my weather window was closing fast.  I picked up the 
pace for the final 5 minutes to get home before the rain. 

The balance of the evening was on the trainer, pedalling _"easish"_ 
and exploring the next 19 kilometres of the Roth bike course.

From _Unterm√§ssing_, it is net uphill going north parallelling the _Autobahn_
and a kicker of a hill before leaving the _Naturpark Altm√ºhltal_ section. 
The road will be fast through _Eys√∂lden_ to the village of _Zell_.

One good thing about today is that my cough is (might be) getting better.

### NOTES

Another so-so sleep.  My best choice to find a lane this 
afternoon is Westshore (12:15-4PM lanes, water walking & 
leisure pool).

Bike parts arrived this afternoon and I hung around until 
they were delivered.  That put me on the back foot for getting 
out to Westshore for the swim.  So...  the run scheduled for 
[tomorrow](javascript:flick('fri');) was done before dinner.
<!----->
Second run in a row where the watch failed to record a GPS 
track until 20 minutes after pressing start.  Hrmm...

The run was done at an **easy effort** mostly on the close-by 
gravel with a trip up to _Marigold_, a couple of trips out to 
_Admirals Road_ and 5 times up _The Berm_.


### HEARTRATE/ELEVATION CHART 
![Run](/assets/jpg/run-20230209.jpeg)
My recorded heartrate seems a bit higher than my RPE. 
Maybe its just the day...

## FRIDAY FEB 10 üå§
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, breathing, glute bridges.  

Run 50 minutes. Longest run in a bit.  
EASY effort. A few rollers or longer hills would be great, 
but not necessary. 

Stretching 27 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2150m**

I felt rested upon rising this morning; its been awhile.  The 
cough is **more bothersome** today though.

I rode up to the pool in _Colwood_ for my first swim there. 
The facility was clean, the water was a bit warm, not a hint 
of chlorine and a bit salty.  I did have a full lane to myself 
though.

Drop-in fee was a dollar more than _Crystal Pool_.
<!----->
If this was summer, I couldn't picture myself riding my bike 
10 minutes past _Thetis Lake_ just to go for a swim in a 25m
pool.  On the otherhand, I did have an hour of easy bike 
commute time...

I swam the 2000m workout from [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');). 

Everything **felt okay**, like I'd missed a week of swimming; 
nothing more. I thought I'd get a some extra lengths in after 
the workout, but after an additional 150m, honesty trumped ego 
and I hopped out of the pool.

### 2000M SWAIM PACE CHART
![Swim](/assets/jpg/swim-20230210.jpeg)
Yes, the last 50m was with some pep.

## SATURDAY FEB 11 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, breathing, glute bridges.  
Mountain bike ~ 2:00-2:15. Get outside. Stay warm. Have fun. 
Easy to steady effort.  Remember to fuel and hydrate.  

### NOTES
Total Time: **160 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **38 km**

Originally, I thought I'd avoid the hills and pedal the 
_Galloping Goose_ out to _Matheson Lake_ and back but I 
**felt good from the start** and chose ride up some hills.

I saw a guy on _Highlands Road_ with a gravel bike who had 
stopped on the shoulder to fix something.  As I rode bym I 
asked if he needed help and he said, "Nope, all good".

Not a minute later, he went flying by me, up and over a hill 
and I thought about how much extra energy this mountain bike 
needs to pedal...
<!----->
Around a corner and over a hill, I spot the guy just up the 
road.  Up the next rise, I pull even with him and the truth is 
now known.  He tried to tell me something but he can barely 
muster a word. He'd blown himself to smithereens.

I pressed on to the park entrance at _Westoby Road_, looking 
back a few time but never to see the guy again. I made it to 
the gate in 27:45.

The _Highlands-Barker-Westoby_ segment was 16 seconds slower 
than [Jan 14th](challenge2023-24weeksout?sat) but still a 
good ride up the hill for me (thanks gravel dude).  

I rode past the entrance to my typical single track trail. 
Through the trees, there looked to be 3 or 4 mountain bikers 
on the trail coming from the opposite direction. No biggie 
because...

Up ahead is a Strava Segment called _"Scafe Hill More Suffering"_. 
It is a fireroad that starts off _Bellamy Trail_ and heads up past 
a lookout point.

In my head, I remind myself a few time over,  
"Smooth is fast and fast is smooth."
<!----->
Near the top I was huffing and puffing pretty good but I 
**smashed my previous time** from a similiar ride 
[last February](ironman2022-27weeksout?sat) by **over 3 minutes**!

After a water/gel break, I continued north up _Bellamy_ for the single 
track of <span style="color:mediumblue;">_Kallie's Korner_ &#9679;</span>;  
a trail that had me pushing my bike on many points in the past.

It wasn't clean but I rode way more of the tricky parts then 
I ever had previously.

_Kallie's Korner_ heading north pops out near the very top of 
_Munn Road_. I was not interesting in going that far and started 
to make my way back to _Thetis Park_ via _Frank's Trail_.  I got 
turned around and ended up on _Munn_ anyway.

Before starting the cold descent down _Munn_ I stopped to address 
the "Gees":

 * Gloves and Glasses
 * Gilet (really nice to have today)
 * and a Gel _(Gu Salted Caramel)_

![Overcast day in BC and I am heading north instead of south.](/assets/jpg/IMG_4555-366x550.jpeg FRANK'S TRAIL)

Passing _Westridge Place_ with 1:38:00 on the clock, I decided 
to spin around and made my way to the southend of _Hartland_.

I bested my time on the road up into the park and then down 
<span style="color:mediumblue;">_Bottom Feeder_ &#9679;</span>.

Making my way home, I started to feel the ride in my legs on 
the final kms at _Panama Flats_.

This was a fun ride and without intension, a very similar 
route (minus a couple single track excursions) to the ride 
on [Feb 26, 2022](ironman2022-27weeksout?sat) referenced 
earlier.

A post-COVID confidence booster.
