# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, May 9, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**16 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Control what I can and if I have to get training done before work, then get it done.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **MANAGING THE EDGE**

On [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');), I missed a quality session on the bike but apart from that, this was a * hour week.

The highlight of the week was that I received my first shot of the Moderna vaccine on [Thursday](javascript:flick('thu');) and the training highlight came with a 96 km lap of _Shawnigan Lake_ on my road bike.  I followed that up with a solid mile run immediately after.

Summer weather is finally here!

Evening lap of Elk Lake.

Couple of brief moments of feeling good but mostly a slog.

Left the park to extend the length of the run knowing that when I get back to my vehicle, the temptation to pack it in would be too great.  Long hill up _Elk Lake Drive_.

Piriformis tired by the ninth kilometre and started to get more irritated by the time I reached the rowing club.

It was cooler this morning or at least it feel cooler riding after a heavy dew last night.

A couple of things in the pool this morning.

First, the water felt heavy, or more specifically, my arms felt heavy, or even more specifically...  
my biceps felt heavy.
<!---->
This was a **good workout** because, just like the run [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');), I had to work through some fatigue.  

Second, backstroke?  That was new.  My watch could not figure out that pattern and creditted me for more than I swam on those lengths.

Before I left the pool for the 30 minute ride, I spent 38 minutes on a conference call from work.

With the call over, I pedalled through _Cook Street Village_ to loop the last bit of _Dallas Road_ before getting on a bike path to home.  Easy effort is really the only effort available to me this morning.

This morning's bike of choice was my road bike.  This morning's 1970's song looping in my head:

**No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature**

### NOTES
Total Time: **31 minutes**

What a glorious morning for a short run; birds chirping, 14¬∞C and no wind.  I jogged to the centre of the _Selkirk Trestle_ and pretty much just made this activity "diaphramic breathing practice".  I wore my old Nike Zoomfly3 shoes just for fun; the same pair that I PR'd the 10K, marathon and used in an impromtu sprint triathlon last August.  They still feel great!

### RIDE NOTES
The ride did not happen, life did.

What started as a good day boiled over with over; commitments from work, the bathroom renovation and not just with me but my sweetheart is going through this too.

Could I have ridden?  Yes.  

Should I have ridden?  I think this was an afternoon and evening that needed engery directed towards us.  There will be plenty of oppertunities to ride in the next coming months.

### NOTES
Total Time: **65 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **10.25 km**

I was out running errands and made that a reason to commute to the _Cedar Hill Rec Centre_ for a chance to run on the cedar chip trail and get some hills in too.   I looked up my lap times from a previous time I ran here (2019?) and I was getting around the golf course in a little over 23 minutes.  

I walked the first hill before hitting the start button on my watch and then settled in for the next hour or so, just enjoying the perfect weather.

Emotionally, this run was very much needed.

Despite hitting 2 brief red lights, I was sub 9-minutes on the commute to the pool this morning.  I was on my road bike
<!---->
Once in the water, I had a **good workout**.  The warmup was in my familiar "continous lane" but the Thursday crowd isn't the Wednesday crowd; to avoid the lane congestion, I moved to the "fast lane" for the main set.

![The Fast Lane](/assets/jpg/swim-20210513.jpeg)

Beautiful morning for an hour's bike ride after the pool.  I rode the waterfront from _Beacon Hill Park_ through _The Uplands_ before turning for home at _Camoson College_.

Left shoulder is **very sore**.   üíâ

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.     
Run 40 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **42 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **7 km**

I didn't sleep that well last night because of some congestion from sawdust (renovation) and a **really sore shoulder** from the inoculation.  Apart from that, I feel pretty good to start the day.  Despite that however, a long running, customer support ticket from hell made for another long, stressful day at work.

Once work was over, I headed to the garage to play _"bike mechanic"_ and see if I could ready my TT bike for a hill or two [tomorrow](javascript:flick('sat');).  Lots of futzing moving gears around on my bikes was to no avail.  I'll need to rethink how I'll get a 30 tooth cassette to work with a derailleur designed to only to reach a 28 tooth gear.
<!---->
I started the run after dinner and right as the sun dipped below the mountains.  My left shoulder was sore, my ankles were a bit tight but when the bike path reached _Quadra Street_, I turned the flat route into a rolling route.

![Run Map](/assets/jpg/runmap-20210514.jpeg)

It could have just been a feeling to make it home before the end of twilight, but the longer I was running, the **stronger** I felt.

## SATURDAY MAY 15 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.  
Ride 3:30-4:00 on road or TT bike. Longer climbing. aka: Malahat. 
Stay hydrated. Stay well fueled. Eat early and often. 
You have an all clear to stop to pee, stop to fill bottles, grab extra food, take photos. 
Steady effort. Covering the distance efficiently. But hopefully you'll still have some energy left in the tank at the end.   
Off the bike. 
Put on your shoes.... run around the block. (Yes, I'm serious) 2 minute jog. How nervous does that make you? How is the stomach? Anything cramping?

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Really good sleep last night and my left shoulder is noticeably less sore.

Second swim secured for the 29th.  Time to get some saddle time...

I must have been excited to get out the door because before I got too far down the road, I realized that I forgot my mini-pump.  Long ride, take two...

I felt good, really good rolling up to _Langford_.  I stopped for a bio-break just before reaching _Goldstream Park_ and then it was time to get to work.  The traffic was heavy going up _Tunnel Hill_ but that wasn't that big of a problem; the debris on the shoulder was.  My effort up the first climb was steady and I could gauge the grade by my heart-rate.  It got as steep as 149 BPM.

At the foot of the highway's second climb, I noticed that I was reeling in another roadie.  Halfway up and just before I caught him, he turned left onto _West Shawnigan Lake Road_.  I was feeling strong and decided to pedal up to the summit of the Malahat.  I had a short stop at the top take a picture before dropping into _Mill Bay_.

I knew that _Shawnigan Mill Bay Road_ was going to be a series of short punchy climbs so I set about getting the work in.  I felt ok and at _Masons Beach_, I saw that roadie again; this time on his way south.  I stopped to top up on fluids, a bottle of Gatorade and a can of Monster Energy Drink.

I really underestimated the climb out of the south end of _Shawnigan Lake_.

The shoulder of the highway going south seemed to be cleaner than the northbound side.  At the top of Tunnel Hill, the cops had a speed trap set up and 3 cars pulled over, all with Alberta licence plates.  I couldn't help but smile and say thank you to an officer as I pedalled through.

The same bush that I visited on the way out of town, received another pit stop.  I really had zero urge to go but I felt "relieved" that I did.

To cap off a fun ride, there was some soft pedalling on downhill sections of _The Galloping Goose_ and some harder efforts just because (the hospital hill, switch bridge).

Flying dismount and into my Nikes, I didn't waste any time getting on to the run.  The jelly in my legs lasted maybe 4 minutes and by the fifth minute, I was heading up the short rise of _Cudethel_ heading for home.  I averaged 5:05/km for a mile off the bike and am feeling incredibly happy with that.
