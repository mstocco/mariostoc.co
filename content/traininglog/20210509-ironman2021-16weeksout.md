Run 90 minutes. Easy effort. Stay well fueled. Rolling terrain. Panama Flats, Layritz, Elk Lake, Thetis all work.

### NOTES

Evening lap of Elk Lake.

Couple of brief moments of feeling good but mostly a slog.

Left the park to extend the length of the run knowing that when I get back to my vehicle, the temptation to pack it in would be too great.  Long hill up _Elk Lake Drive_.

Piriformis tired by the ninth kilometre and started to get more irritated by the time I reached the rowing club.

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 minutes**

It was cooler this morning or at least it feel cooler riding after a heavy dew last night.

A couple of things in the pool this morning.

First, the water felt heavy, or more specifically, my arms felt heavy, or even more specifically...  
my biceps felt heavy.
<!---->
This was a good workout because, just like the run [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');), I had to work through some fatigue.  Second, backstroke?  That was new.

Before I left the pool for the 30 minute ride, I spent 38 minutes on a conference call from work.

With the call over, I pedalled through _Cook Street Village_ to loop the last bit of _Dallas Road_ before getting on a bike path to home.  Easy effort is really the only effort available to me this morning.
