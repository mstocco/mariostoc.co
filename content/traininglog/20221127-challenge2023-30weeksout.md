### NOTES
Swim: **2500m / 57 Mins** &nsbp; Treadmill: **30 Mins**

I worked in the morning before walking across downtown to the _Vancouver Aquatic Centre_.

The place is a definitely a dated facility but the water was the right temperature for lengths and for the most part, I had 50m lane for half the time I was in the water.  7:52 and 7:50 for the 400m reps.

I didn't think that I was feeling particularly strong but I stuck to the schedule; I think this was **productive** time in the water.

Back at the hotel, I found the gym and spent ~30 easy minutes on treadmill.  Given the snow, I will be back on this contraption again [tomorrow](javascript:flick('wed');)
