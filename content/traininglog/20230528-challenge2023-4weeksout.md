### NOTES
Total Time: **7:04:00** &nbsp; Distance: **70.3 miles**

My fastest 1900m swim on Elk Lake.  I broke my 40 km PR and
finished the bike ~11 minutes quicker than last year.

Then I turned my ego off and walked, a lot!

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Walk/Run: **7.2 km**
 
Between work and chores, I was late getting out the door for the swim.  Later in the evening I found a nasty hot spot, right where my broken clavicle is.  Swimming may not have worked today.

In lieu (before noticing the clavicle), I added an extra 20 minutes of walking to my _"second"_ workout.  Legs are a bit tired and maybe I was landing a bit heavy this afternoon; my right ankle felt weaker for the later 2 minute reps.   Pretty consistent 5:30/km during the 2 minute reps; I would have honestly guessed 6:30/km.  The clock in my head is way off.
