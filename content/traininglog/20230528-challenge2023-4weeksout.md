### NOTES
Total Time: **7:04:00** &nbsp; Distance: **70.3 miles**

My fastest 1900&#8239;m swim on Elk Lake.  I broke my 40&#8239;km PR and
finished the bike ~11 minutes quicker than last year.

Then I turned my ego off and walked, a lot!

300 easy swim.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Walk/Run: **7.2&#8239;km**
 
Missed my afternoon swim window.  In lieu, I added 20 minutes of walking to my _"second"_ workout.  Tired legs and maybe I was landing heavy, my right ankle felt weaker during the last few reps.   Pretty consistent 5:30/km during the 2 minute reps; I would have honestly guessed 6:30/km.  The clock in my head is way off.

Angry tissue flair up around my right clavicle; swimming may not have worked earlier today.

Total Time: **105 Minutes** &nbsp; MTB Ride: **25&#8239;km**

The superior fibers of my trapezius (at the right clavicle) is still sore, but less acute this morning.  My right ankle feels better than I expected.

Late start to the ride as I was in town picking up a lower stack runner for my ankle. 

31 minutes to the _Westoby Road Gate_; bit of a headwind, bit of [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) still in my legs.  I felt stronger the longer I rode and explored a new bit of single track.  The _Scotch Broom_ has taken over and some trails are impassable now.

### NOTES
Time: **97&#8239;Mins** &nbsp; Swim: **2000&#8239;m** &nbsp; Walk/Run: **5.3&#8239;km**

Sleep through the night but had a groggy morning.  Productive day at work before going to the pool.  Weather is sunny but just  17&deg;C. 
<!----->
First 100m length (warm up) was done in 1:39 and I was pretty consistent in getting low 1:40s (or better) for the entire workout.  This despite my right elbow being sore from an interaction with a rock during the MTB ride [last night](javascript:flick('wed');).

Could it be that the swimming in the wetsuit reset the _"level"_ in my head?  Or maybe the uptick in speed is due to having shaved my legs for the race.  Whatever, this was **a fun workout**.

I did the run from _Crystal Pool_ to _Royal Jubilee Hospital_ and back.  Flat route with different underfoot variations from the sidewalks.  This was a **new shoe day**.  Effort was relaxed and I am really liking the rhythm of 2 minutes on, 1 off as I use it to give me a positive reset for my run posture.

Another groggy morning; night sweats last night too.  I am congested and I don't know if it is a cold coming on or seasonal allergies (which haven't really appeared so far this year).

Right ankle feels pretty good this morning.
