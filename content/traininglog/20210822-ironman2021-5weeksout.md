### NOTES
Total Time: **~40 minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **~1800m**

Carina and I drove up to _Shawnigan Lake_ this afternoon.  The weather was a cloudy but the winds that Victoria was experiencing were non-existant here.  I really had no desire to get wet but we had the Carina's paddle board on the top of the car and she really wanted to get on the water.  I am thankful that she did.

Once in the water though, everything felt really good.  Although I didn't capture the planned workout correctly with my watch, I felt like I could have been in the water for double the time.

Maybe my worse swim to date and it wasn't fatigue or soreness or not being on time or, or, or.

My head was in a spot with the thought about what's next instead of what's now.  I programmed the workout into my watch wrong last night but it wasn't until the 600m effort that I ended up doing 300 and calling it done.  I collected myself and swam a bunch more lengths and if I was to guess, I'd estimate that I did 2500m but it wasn't as coach wrote it up.

### Important Participant Information
Dear IRONMAN Canada – Penticton Athlete, 

Over the challenging and constantly evolving landscape of the last year and a half, our team has continued to work hard in an effort to create the best race experience and welcome you back to the IRONMAN Canada - Penticton start line. We felt optimistic and had high hopes for the updated 2021 IRONMAN Canada - Penticton race date scheduled for September 26, 2021.

There's more to that email but needless to say, I am going to need to process and reframe things for me on this journey.
