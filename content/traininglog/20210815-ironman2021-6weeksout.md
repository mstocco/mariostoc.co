**6 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Important Bike Week. 

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...  
<sup>(completed at the end of the week)</sup>
<!--OVERTRAINING|ON THE EDGE|STAYING CONSISTENT|LAGGING A BIT-->

## SUNDAY AUG 15
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 4:30++ I'd rather you ride 4:45 than 4:15. Over 5 hours is probably a bit too much. 

#### Goals: 
* Steady effort all ride. 
* Start your fueling early. Stay consistent. 
* Stop to refill bottles earlier rather than later. 
* Get in a few steady/longer climbs

### NOTES
Total Moving Time: **290 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **125 km**

Left home about 45 minutes after a big blueberry pancake breakfast.  Consumed 3 bottles with 100g of lemonade mix, 2 Maurten gels (one caffeinated, one regular), a packet of Reboost Maple Syrup (100 calories) and about 200 calories of Maynards (14 pieces).  I did pack a packet of Maurten 320 drink mix with me but while stopped for water at _Masons Beach_, I spilled an unknown quantity on the ground.  A shame because I don't know the calories from the product I was able to keep in the bottle.

## TUESDAY AUG 17
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Spin 60 minutes. Any bike. EASY. Avoid climbs

Run 30 minutes. Flat route. EASY. 
Easy is in ALL CAPS for a reason. 
You normally do this just fine. But now is the time to reiterate this point. As Sunday is a big day. And so is Wednesday.

## WEDNESDAY AUG 18
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:30 on TT bike. I'd like you to get in OVER 2500 feet of total vertical. 

I think riding to Willis Point is your best bet. And the climb is the most similar to your races. 
4-5x Willis. No need to go to the back side! No need to do the final steep pitch either! 
Steady riding. Riding like you need to get somewhere, but NOT like your hard efforts. This is about amassing a large amount of climbing in one ride.  
_Fuel like a race. Hydrate like a race. Because......_

Run 60 minutes. Flat route. Best breathing/form you have. Easy to "steady". Aka: Let the run come to you. And don't hold back if you find a flow. Conversely, if you do NOT find a flow. Stay calm, and find out what works on the day.   
_Again, fuel like a race, hydrate like a race_
