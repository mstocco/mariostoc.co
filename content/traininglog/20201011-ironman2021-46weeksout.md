# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, October 11, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(3);)

**46 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I have been consistent with training for the past few weeks.  My goal this week is to continue with that same momentum and try to get a bit more sleep than last week.

## SUMMARY
I feel like I was **PUSHING BOUNDARIES**

This week's goal was to get a bit more sleep; I don't know how well I accomplished that.  I did feel pretty heavy legged on the back half of the week which lets me know that the training stimulus is where it needs to be.

I started the week with a good run in the rain on [Sunday](javascript:flkty.select(3);) and had a great quality session at the track on [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(7);).

Stress did catch up with me by [Thursday](javascript:flkty.select(10);) but I feel like I did my best to get myself back on track for [Friday](javascript:flkty.select(11);) and [Saturday](javascript:flkty.select(12);).

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **10 miles**

Another sound sleep; nice!  I made a great tasting coffee and had a sweet pastry before heading out for today's run.

I wasn't 10 minutes down the road when the rain started to fall.  Funny thing, I am happy to run in the rain but if I have to ride in the stuff, it becomes a procrastination show.  I had an idea of the direction I wanted to run to get in a hillier route but nothing concrete.  I darted of into the subdivision behind the View Royal Fire Hall and is was wonderfully hilly.
<!---->
The rain became heavier the closer I got to Colwood so once out of that sub-division, I doubled back to work in the up and downs of Helmcken Road.  I stayed on Helmcken, past the Hospital and started making my way home through the Knockan Hill area of Wilkinson Road.  The flattest section of today's run was the last 10 minutes on the Goose.  

I had gels at the 20, 50 and 70 minute marks and drank about 300ml of plain water.  I took it easy when going uphill and refrained from smashing myself when going down.  Overall, I **felt great** from start to finish.  I ran a bit extra to make today an even 10 miles.

## CANADIAN THANKSGIVING DAY ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
15 Minutes of mobility

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I was rolling with the lacrosse ball during the Seahawks game last night and I found a new hotspot on the lateral side of my left soleus.  The hotspots from last week (right quad, right glute med) have worked themselves out.

Last night I slept soundly.

I took the day to get some light work around the yard in.  The trellis for my beans was blown oven by yesterday's wind and heartbreakingly, my surf ski was damaged bu the windstorm too; there is a spiderweb of cracks in the carbon fibre.  I am sure the I can repair it but it will be a lot of work and I am not sure if the repair would cost more that a new boat.  Bummer because I was hoping to get in a paddle today.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 60 minutes. EASY   
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I slept for 7 and a half hours last night and I woke to a rare, early morning thunderstorm.  Although I woke up feeling refreshed, I am still bummed out about my broken surf ski.

The weather today saw incredibly heavy wind and rain for most of the day.  I took advantage of a break in the weather and did the jog in some sunshine.  **Pace was easy** and my soleus hotspot was a non-issue.  My ankles took about 20 minutes to _"release"_ and the last 10 was comfortable.

The hour with the TT bike on the rollers was **steady and uneventful** and I watched the latest Apple iPhone 12 Release video.

## WEDNESDAY OCT 14 üå§
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 20 minutes.   
Run 75 minutes: 20 minutes easy running to warm up. 8x 300 strides @ 5k effort/pace @ 1:14-1:16s per 300, 100 as 20 meters slowing to a walk, 60 meters walking, 20 meters shuffling back to a run. NOT TOO FAST!
Then.. 2x 12 minutes @ 1/2 marathon effort/feel (lets aim for 5:08-5:15 per km) 5 minutes WALKING after each effort. 10 minutes easy jogging to cool down.   
_Ideally you'll do this on the track and you'll have at least 200 calories on hand. AND enough water._

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 minutes**

I slept well last night.

I did today's mobility routine just before driving to PISE.

<!---->
I pressed start on the watch to get things going with the 20 minute warm up.  I heard the beep telling me that the watch has found some GPS signal; I was expecting a second beep to tell me that my foot pod has connected too.  I looked down at my shoes to realize that that foot pad is on a pair of shoes at home.  I jogged a few laps agonizing over whether or not to go home a get the foot pod.  Another easy lap and I deemed the foot pod as a crutch and I committed to do this workout on feel.  To do so, I just needed to figure out where a 300m mark is painted on the track.  There was a blue line and a yellow in what I'd call turn 4 that looked to be close.  I picked the yellow line as it was the furthest from my starting point.

Effort on the 8x300 was **pretty consistent**.  I heard my coach's voice in my head saying, _"Going faster will only hurt the actual workout."_  The sixth effort felt like work; the seventh and eighth felt good. The 2x12 minute tempo efforts went by quickly as I settled into a **comfortable**, 5:12/km rhythm.

<!---->
I brought a 600ml water bottle to the track mixed with 46g of Gatorade.  I sipped this throughout the warm up, took a good swig during the recovery period 5 of 8 and sipped again during the 5 minute recovery walk between the 12 minute efforts.  I consumed a little more than half, or roughly **90 calories**.

After the last 5 minute recovery walk, the 10 minute cool down felt like a run off the bike.

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes on road or MTB. Hilly route. Have fun. Overall effort is easy to moderate. No intervals. Nothing too hard.  
If your legs are toast from Wednesday....make it a flatter ride!

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Probably the worst sleep I've had in months.  So much for my weekly goal of getting better sleep.

Rough day and to compound things, I was hit with a pounder of a headache; I suspect that it was a caffeine withdrawal headache as I skipped the coffee this morning knowing that I didn't sleep last night.

2 Advil with dinner and going to bed early.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 22 minutes.  
Run 40 minutes. Flat and EASY. Then... 10x :20 flat strides @ 5k effort or so (NOT SPRINTS) :40 walk after each. 10 minute jog to finish up.

### NOTES
Total Time: **53 minutes**

Rested!  I woke up feeling much better today.

I noticed a bit of atypical soreness in my left ankle to start the run.  I jogged the warmup to 32 minutes instead of the full 40 because I wanted to get the strides in with the remaining daylight; **heavy legs** may have influenced the decision.

During the strides, I skipped nicely off the ground, even if for just 20 seconds at a time.  The walk breaks in between helped too.

Tonight, a spectacularly colourful sunset painted the sky as I crossed the trestle.

Ride 1:45 on MTB. Get outside. Have fun. Hills are great, but not mandatory.  
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort

### NOTES
Total Time: **180 minutes**

Just an okay sleep last night; about 7 hours.  My legs continue to feel heavy today.  With most of the Saturday chores done, I finally got those heavy legs out the door.

Once on my XC bike, my mood brightened but my legs continued to feel cooked.  I made my way on the Goose toward Thetis Lake Park.  Having more time on a Saturday, I decided to try the _Panhandle Trail_; this is rated _"blue"_ on Trail Forks and the reason I haven't attempted it in the past.   Turns out, this trail is a non-technical fire road linking _Highlands Road_ with _Munn Road_ with one power-sapping climb in the middle.
<!---->
I was ~40 minutes to _Munn_; plenty of time to find the trailhead to _Regional Trail South_.  I found the _"trailhead"_ as listed on my Garmin bike computer but it quickly turned into a _"hike-a-bike show"_ for the final 300m through thick brush to get to where I was going.

Once on _Regional Trail South_, I made my way to a proper _"blue trail"_ called _"Executive West"_.  This was a fun trail, mostly downhill in the direction I was travelling.  Before heading back to paved roads, I took a quick detour to check out [Killarney Lake](/pictures/victoria/killarney-lake).

Once out of the park, it was _Goward Road_ to _Glendale Trail_ for the way home.  So far, my legs felt **pretty fatigued** before and during this ride; the ride home felt no different.  I was skeptical about the scheduled run.  I took my time to put my bike away and get into some running kit.

Once in my Nikes, I took it easy.  To my **honest surprise**, it was less than 3 minutes down the street before I **felt pretty good**, reacting with the ground.  I jogged my typical route on the Lochside Trail to Quadra Street and back.
