# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, January 1, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**25** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
New week, new year, same goal of consistency.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **12.5 Hours**

I feel like I was **TRAINING**

Huge week in the grand scheme of things; nice to get it all in with the week off work and some dry weather moments.  Two fun MTB rides around _Mount Stewart_, some focused efforts in the pool and easy running made up the bulk of the week.

Hit all the workouts as written except for [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) where a lack of lifeguards cut my pool time short.

FedEx dropped off a new bike frame but what was in the box was a size M. üò°

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Dead bugs, Breathing, Glute Bridges.**  
Trainer 90 minutes: 
20 minutes easy warm up.
12x :30 high cadence/stable hips, :45 easy after each. 
5 minutes easy riding. 
8x 2:00, Big gear work, low cadence (70-80 range is appropriate for you, for now) high torque, power should be in the 165-200 range, 3:00 easy spinning after each. 
10 minutes easy to finish up.

Run 60 minutes. Easy effort; terrain is up to you, but keep the effort EASY. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **153 Mins** &nbsp;Run: **9.99 km** &nbsp;Trainer: **yes**

By the time we got home, it was getting to be later in the afternoon.  I did the jog first and carried a 500ml bottle with 60g of homemade carbohydrate mix in my hip belt.  Easy effort on the standard gravel route _(Panama Flats)_.   No aches or pains.
<!----->
![Run](/assets/jpg/run-20230102.jpeg)

Getting in the door and on to the trainer.  I had another bottle (710ml) ready to go with 70g of mix for the next 90 minutes.  I was NOT looking forward to the low cadence reps.  When I got to them however, it wasn't as bad as I thought.  I set the trainer at ~191 W and focused on holding 70 RPM with my hands on the bull horns.  I'd go back to the aerobars in between the reps.

A **solid afternoon** and I am **feeling good**.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2800: 
200 easy free, 200 easy w/ buoy, 100 steady kick. 
5x 200 as 15 meters high turnover/strong effort, 35 meters RELAXED and smooth. R :30 after each. 
2x 50 easy kick to loosen up.
400, 300, 200, 100 aerobic/smooth w/ focus on rotation and sighting 4x per 50. R :45 after each.

### NOTES
Total Time: **75 Minutes** &nbsp;Swim:<mark> **2850m** </mark> 

Part of it was me, but my watch didn't credit me for the 400m length.  My mistake was doing another 100m kick in place of a 200m free.  Regardless, I got wet and was working at becoming a better swimmer.

**Bonus:** Carina recorded a short video of me after 2700m.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **2**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Dead bugs, Breathing, Glute Bridges.**

MTB ~ 1:40-1:50
Get outside, have fun, stay warm, stay as try as you can.
Remember to eat and drink! Generaly effort is easy to steady. 

Mobility 25 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **115 Minutes** &nbsp; MTB Ride: **29 km**

Before heading out, I pumped 30 psi into the front and rear tires of my Rocky Mountain to see if it'd make a difference...  Question answered. 

I finally went sub-30 minutes (29:03) to the gate at _Westoby Road_!  Typically with this bike, I am there in 32-ish minutes.
Appearantly I wasn't done because after the gate, there is a 2.1 km Strava Segment that includes my favorite bit of single track; I crushed that today too.

<!----->
30 psi did have a noticeable (adverse) effect on rear wheel traction on the steep rocky bits.

#### TLR weekly cfg 4:  13:51

It was nice to get this ride in before the weather turns wet for the foresable future.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2800: 
2 Rounds (100 easy swim, 100 easy w/ buoy, 50 steady kick. Rest as needed after each)

5 Rounds (50 build to strong. R :30, 250 aerobic/steady/smooth. R :45)
4x 50 EASY to cool down.

Run 50 minutes. Hilly route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **2800m** &nbsp;Run: **7.4 km**

Extra effort in the pool after a _"swim focused"_ weekly call with Elliot.  My body would have been fine with just the swim on but I had a run as well.

I hit _"The Berm"_ for 16 reps that got me ~220m of elevation.  Wind gusts made the hill steeper.

## FRIDAY JAN 6 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

<h3 style="color:#aaa;">COACH'S NOTES</h3>
<p style="background-color:#ddd;color:#aaa;">
 This is the same as <a href="javascript:flick('wed');">Wednesday...</a>
 I'm hoping you can get outside one day (or both) And if not, I can write a second trainer set for Friday. 
 I'd prefer two outside rides, but I realize that is asking a lot for the first week of January. 
</p>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Option A: MTB ~ 1:40-1:50. 
Get outside, have fun, stay warm, stay as try as you can.
Remember to eat and drink! Generaly effort is easy to steady.  
<strike>Option B: Trainer 1:25</strike>

Mobilty 22 minutes  

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 Minutes** &nbsp; MTB Ride: **29 km**

First drop of rain felt as I arrived home; 40 seconds later the rain came down!  I could not have timed it better.
<!----->
Similar ride up to _Thetis_ but I was ~40 seconds slower to the gate.  After a short break, I ripped both the Strava Segments, Noron and TLR weekly cfg 4, setting PRs on both.  I was roughly 57 minutes total to the gate at _Davies Road_ (last year it was closer to an hour).

I explored a bit of single track from there only to find a private property/no riding sign at the end of the trail.  I did need to push my bike for a short bit and once back on rideable terrain, I finished the ride on familiar path(s).  

I **felt strong** on the push home and a finished with a bit more vertical than [Wednesday...](javascript:flick('wed');).

## SATURDAY JAN 7 üåß
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 40 minutes EASY.
Best footing you can find. Generally a flat run. Save some energy for the swim. 

2nd: Swim 2500:
2 rounds (100 easy swim, 50 steady kick...keeping the kick tight and controlled. Rest as needed after each) 
2 rounds (8x 50 w/ form focus. In this case...playing around with more force with your hand into the water, aka: More rotation, aka: slightly higher turnover. R :30 after each. Giving yourself time to reset after each rep. 100 EASY and relaxed after each round) 
4x 250 aerobic/smooth. Focus on breathing and feeling comfortable. R 1:00 after each. 
4x 50 super easy to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **72 Mins** Swim: <mark>700m</mark> Run(s): **53 mins**

Spent the morning watching the rain come down hard.  No let up at all.

<!----->
Carina drove me to the pool with the idea that I'd run on a treadmill and then swim the 50m lanes at 1530.  That plan started ok...

I noticing that there was an Assault AirRunner at the pool.  I've always wanted to try one.  
It did not disappoint.  Far more engaging that a regular treadmill; fun.

![Run 1](/assets/jpg/run1-20230107.jpeg)

<!----->
Once the 50m lanes were set up, I got into the water.  Unfortunately,the pool closed early; not enough life guards.

Plan B: jog home.  Why not as I had running kit with me and the rain had turned into a drizzle.
