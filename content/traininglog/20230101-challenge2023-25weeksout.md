### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Dead bugs, Breathing, Glute Bridges.**  
Trainer 90 minutes: 
20 minutes easy warm up.
12x :30 high cadence/stable hips, :45 easy after each. 
5 minutes easy riding. 
8x 2:00, Big gear work, low cadence (70-80 range is appropriate for you, for now) high torque, power should be in the 165-200 range, 3:00 easy spinning after each. 
10 minutes easy to finish up.

Run 60 minutes. Easy effort; terrain is up to you, but keep the effort EASY. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **153 Mins** &nbsp;Run: **9.99 km** &nbsp;Trainer: **yes**

By the time we got home, it was getting to be later in the afternoon.  I did the jog first and carried a 500ml bottle with 60g of homemade carbohydrate mix in my hip belt.  Easy effort on the standard gravel route _(Panama Flats)_.   No aches or pains.

Getting in the door and on to the trainer.  I had another bottle (710ml) ready to go with 70g of mix for the next 90 minutes.  I was NOT looking forward to the low cadence reps.  When I got to them however, it wasn't as bad as I thought.  I set the trainer at ~191 W and focused on holding 70 RPM with my hands on the bull horns.  I'd go back to the aerobars in between the reps.

A **solid afternoon** and I am **feeling good**.

### NOTES

Part of it was me, but my watch didn't credit me for the 400m length.  My mistake was doing another 100m kick in place of a 200m free.  Regardless, I got wet and was working at getting better.  Bonus round completed with Carina getting a short video of me after the work was done.

### NOTES
Total Time: **115 Minutes** &nbsp; MTB Ride: **29 km**

This ride was **fun** as it had a bit of everything, pavement, fire road and single track.  Before heading out, I put 30psi, front and rear, into the tires to see if it'd make a difference.  I'd have to say yes as on my Rocky Mountain, I finally went sub-30 minutes to the north entrance to the park.  Actually it was 29:01!  Typically on this bike, I am at the gate in 32-ish minutes.
