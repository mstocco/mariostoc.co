## WEEKLY GOAL
With a little over 8 hours of scheduled training through Friday and no swimming (didn't get a lane booked), my goal is to again, put together another week of consistency.  I am looking forward to the _Q Day_ on [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(6);) in particular.

## SUNDAY NOV 08 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 45 minutes: 20 minutes easy to warm up. 15x :30 strides, Odds: :30 walk after, evens: :30 Jog after. 10 minutes easy to cool down.
Ride 90 minutes on MTB. Trails or dirt trail. Up to you. Overall an easy to moderate effort ride. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **85 minutes**

Today's run started well; during the warm up everything pointed to this being a good workout.  Then _beep, beep, beep_, the workout started.  The first strides are typically slow and awkward; today was no different.  The next nine strides were **on schedule** though and if that was all I had to do, I would have finished patting myself on the back.  The eleventh stride was a chore and a message for me to hold focus for the remaining reps.  The last four strides were work with a lot of **huffing and puffing** in between.  The slow jog home was welcomed.

Left glute/adductor/hamstring was sore during the strides this morning.  I rolled things out while watching the Seahawks get thumped by the Bills; the tender culprit may be that side's piriformis which was pretty knotted up.

This afternoon I **struggled** with motivation to get on the MTB (or any bike). I looked at my yard, leaves everywhere, grass looking shaggy; I gave myself a reason to procrastinate.  An hour-thirty later, the yard looked fantastic but I still wasn't keen on a ride.  Regardless, I put my winter kit on, changed a tube on my road bike and headed out for 40 minutes.  I felt ok noodling on flat terrain but on the smallest of inclines, my legs asked, _"is it is [Monday](javascript:flkty.select(5);) yet?"_

### PLANNED WORKOUT
20 Minute Full Body Flexibiliy Routine V3!

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

_"Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning."_

As stunning as the sunsets have been over the past few days, today the sunrise got into the act too.  Wet weather is forecast for the next 10 days and there may even be snow on the _Malahat_ this afternoon.  Welcome Winter, we've been expecting you.

I woke stiff and sore and am looking forward to this recovery day.

In the evening, I spent 30 minutes with my massage chair working on the knots in my back, then another 15 minutes on the roller working my piriformis and quads.  The quads felt tender and the left piriformis almost felt bruised.  I also worked a hotspot on the anterior left ankle.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes on the rollers. 20 minutes easy to warm up. 2 rounds (:10, :20, :30, :40, :50 high cadence on 1:00) 5:00 easy. 3x 3:00 @ slightly higher cadence than normal, 2:00 easy after each. 10 minutes easy to cool down.  
Run 30 minutes. Flat and easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I was up once during the night but overall, this was an ok sleep.  My back still feels knotted up (acending part of my right trapezius) and my left ankle is very angry after the workover last night. 

I did the jog first; there was some daylight after a mentally long day on the keyboard.  This run only sucked a little bit.  **Very little juice** in my legs and given how I've felt the past two days, I took the trail around _Swan Lake_ and limit the crashing into the asphalt.

<!---->
The session on the rollers was the opposite of the jog.  I **felt good** on the bike tonight and I think I executed the workout as written.

## REMEMBERANCE DAY üá®üá¶
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
25 Minute Climbers Mobility Routine

Run 70 minutes: 15 minutes easy jogging to warm up. 8x 150 meter (give or take) strides, 150 meter EASY jogging between each. Walk 1-3 minutes. Then.. 6.4km tempo @ 5:05-5:18 pace. Essentially 1/2 marathon effort or so. 10 minute easy jog to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **68 minutes**

7 Hours of sleep and I didn't wake feeling rested.  Regardless, I had a productive day at work and a weather window to work with late this afternoon.

The run started pretty good and got better the further I made it down the Goose.  The first stride started just past the _Selkirk Trestle_ and it wasn't as awkward as the first stride typically is.  The remainder of the the strides felt good and in control.  A hint of soreness in my left piriformis was noticed and worked as a reminder to keep the strides, strides and not sprints.

I did a lap of the _Songhess_ before heading north on the _Goose_ for the 4 mile tempo effort.  I locked into a 5:05/km pace early and held that effort for 33:18.  The back half of the effor was uphill or false-flat uphill and that may have dropped my average pace, but not the effort.
