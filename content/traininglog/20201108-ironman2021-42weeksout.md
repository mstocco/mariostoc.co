# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, November 8, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(3);)

**42 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
With a little over 8 hours of scheduled training through Friday and no swimming (didn't get a lane booked), my goal is to again, put together another week of consistency.  I am looking forward to the _Q Day_ on [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(6);) in particular.

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 45 minutes: 20 minutes easy to warm up. 15x :30 strides, Odds: :30 walk after, evens: :30 Jog after. 10 minutes easy to cool down.
Ride 90 minutes on MTB. Trails or dirt trail. Up to you. Overall an easy to moderate effort ride. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **85 minutes**

Today's run started well; during the warm up everything pointed to this being a good workout.  Then _beep, beep, beep_, the workout started.  The first strides are typically slow and awkward; today was no different.  The next strides were on schedule through the 10th and if that was all I had to do, I would have finished patting myself on the back.  The eleventh stride was a chore and message for me to hold focus for the remaining reps.  The remaining 4 strides were work with a lot of **huffing and puffing** in between.  The slow jog home was welcomed.

Left glute/adductor/hamstring was sore during the strides this morning.  I rolled things out while watching the Seahawks get thumped by the Bills; the tender culprit may be that side's piriformis which was pretty knotted up.

This afternoon I **struggled** with motivation to get on the MTB (or any bike). I looked at my yard, leaves everywhere, grass looking shaggy; I gave myself a reason to procrastinate.  An hour-thirty later, the yard looked fantastic but I still wasn't keen on a ride.  Regardless, I got my winter kit on, changed a tube on my road bike and headed out for 40 minutes.  I felt ok noodling on flat terrain but on the smallest of inclines, my legs asked, "is it is Monday yet?"
