Week beginning [Sunday, November 8, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(3);)

**42 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
With a little over 8 hours of scheduled training through Friday and no swimming (didn't get a lane booked), my goal is to again, put together another week of consistency.  I am looking forward to the _Q Day_ on [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(8);) in particular.

## SUNDAY NOV 08 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 45 minutes: 20 minutes easy to warm up. 15x :30 strides, Odds: :30 walk after, evens: :30 Jog after. 10 minutes easy to cool down.
Ride 90 minutes on MTB. Trails or dirt trail. Up to you. Overall an easy to moderate effort ride. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **85 minutes**

Today's run started well; during the warm up everything pointed to this being a good workout.  Then _beep, beep, beep_, the workout started.  The first strides are typically slow and awkward; today was no different.  The next nine strides were **on schedule** though and if that was all I had to do, I would have finished patting myself on the back.  The eleventh stride was a chore and a message for me to hold focus for the remaining reps.  The last four strides were work with a lot of **huffing and puffing** in between.  The slow jog home was welcomed.
<!---->
Left glute/adductor/hamstring was sore during the strides this morning.  I rolled things out while watching the Seahawks get thumped by the Bills; the tender culprit may be that side's piriformis which was pretty knotted up.

This afternoon I **struggled** with motivation to get on the MTB (or any bike). I looked at my yard, leaves everywhere, grass looking shaggy; I gave myself a reason to procrastinate.  An hour-thirty later, the yard looked fantastic but I still wasn't keen on a ride.  Regardless, I put my winter kit on, changed a tube on my road bike and headed out for 40 minutes.  I felt ok noodling on flat terrain but on the smallest of inclines, my legs asked, _"is it is [Monday](javascript:flkty.select(5);) yet?"_

### PLANNED WORKOUT
20 Minute Full Body Flexibiliy Routine V3!

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

_"Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning."_

As stunning as the sunsets have been over the past few days, today the sunrise got into the act too.  Wet weather is forecast for the next 10 days and there may even be snow on the _Malahat_ this afternoon.

I woke stiff and sore and am looking forward to this recovery day.

In the evening, I spent 30 minutes with my massage chair working on the knots in my back, then another 15 minutes on the roller working my piriformis and quads.  The quads felt tender and the left piriformis almost felt bruised.  I also worked a hotspot on the anterior left ankle.

## TUESDAY NOV 10 üå§
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes on the rollers. 20 minutes easy to warm up. 2 rounds (:10, :20, :30, :40, :50 high cadence on 1:00) 5:00 easy. 3x 3:00 @ slightly higher cadence than normal, 2:00 easy after each. 10 minutes easy to cool down.  
Run 30 minutes. Flat and easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I was up once during the night; overall sleep was _"just okay"_.  My back still feels knotted up (acending part of my right trapezius) and my left ankle is _"very angry"_ after the workover last night.

I did the jog first; there was some daylight after a mentally long day on the keyboard.  This run only sucked a little bit.  **Very little juice** in my legs and given how I've felt the past two days, I took the trail around _Swan Lake_ and limit the crashing into the asphalt.

<!---->
The session on the rollers was the opposite of the jog.  I **felt good** on the bike tonight and I think I executed the workout as written.  I had highlights of the 1989 Tour de France on the screen.

## WEDNESDAY &mdash; REMEMBERANCE DAY üá®üá¶
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
25 Minute Climbers Mobility Routine

Run 70 minutes: 15 minutes easy jogging to warm up. 8x 150 meter (give or take) strides, 150 meter EASY jogging between each. Walk 1-3 minutes. Then.. 6.4km tempo @ 5:05-5:18 pace. Essentially 1/2 marathon effort or so. 10 minute easy jog to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **68 minutes**

7 Hours of sleep and sadly, I did not wake feeling rested.  Regardless, I had a productive day at work and I had a dry weather window for my late afternoon workout.

The run felt pretty **good to start** as I headed toward town on the _Galloping Goose_.  The first stride started just past the _Selkirk Trestle_ and it wasn't as awkward as a first stride typically is.

<!---->
The remainder of the the **strides felt good** and in control.  A hint of soreness in my left piriformis was noticed and served as a subtle reminder to keep the strides as strides and not sprints.

For the 4 mile tempo effort, I did a lap of the _Songhess_ before heading back north on the _Goose_.  I locked into a **comfortably hard**, 5:06/km pace, early and held that effort for 33:18.  The back half of the tempo had some uphill and false-flat uphill sections that dropped my average pace to 5:12/km; I kept the effort the same regardless.

Overall, this was a honest (and fun) workout.

## THURSDAY NOV 12
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
15 Minute Runners Flexibility Routine  
Rollers ~ 50 minutes EASY. Legs might be a bit tired. That's ok! 

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 minutes**

Not the best sleep ever but the best sleep I have had this week.  I guess a [good run](javascript:flkty.select(8);) will do that.

There isn't much to write about the workout on the rollers except that it was an easy effort that (hopefully) flushed out the legs.  I watched the latest Trainer Road video and they talked about training by RPE.  Besically everything that Elliot has me doing for the past year.

## FRIDAY NOV 13 üå¶
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 70 minutes. Inside or outside. Any bike you like. Go spin. Have fun. Keep it easy  
Run 40 minutes. Easy effort.

<p style="font-size:1rem;margin-bottom:0;color:#ff8c00" class="agencyvc">Wind Warning for Greater Victoria</p>
<p style="color:#ff8c00;font-size:0.9em;border-top:1px solid #ff8c00;">
A low pressure centre over the South Coast this morning will move into the southern BC interior in the afternoon. In the wake of the low, westerly winds of 70 km/h gusting to 90 will develop in Greater Victoria near Juan de Fuca Strait this afternoon. The winds will ease this evening.</p>

### NOTES
Total Time: **113 minutes**

After a quick cup of coffee and a weather window, it was shoes on then out the door for the run.  I felt **surprisingly good**; zero protest from the ankle/soleus group.  I kept it _"easy effort"_ regardless.  The weather started at the 40 minute mark and I was still about 4 minutes from home.

<!---->
Given the potential of today's forecast, I was happy to have at least the run completed.

### FRIDAY MORNING'S ROUTE
![Run Map](/assets/jpg/runmap-20201113.jpeg)

The ride was in the garage after dinner.  I had the _2020 UCI Elite Men's XC Race_ on the screen (volume turned off) and a _Crushing Iron_ podcast playing on my iPhone.  Time flew by.  There was no cadences to hit, no programmed timed efforts, but I was **pretty stoked** to get over an hour of steady Z2 heart rate work in.  Building the base.

## SATURDAY NOV 14 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 20 minutes.  
Run 40 minutes: 20 minutes easy to start. 10x :15 strides (just enough for a bit of turnover) :45 easy after each. 10 minutes easy to cool down.

<p style="font-size:1rem;margin-bottom:0;color:#ff8c00" class="agencyvc">ANOTHER Wind Warning for Greater Victoria</p><p style="color:#ff8c00;font-size:0.9em;border-top:1px solid #ff8c00;">Southeast winds of 70 km/h are expected for Greater Victoria near Haro Strait.  A frontal system will cross Vancouver Island late this evening. Ahead of the front, strong southeasterly winds will develop over Haro Strait and the Strait of Georgia. Winds will peak early this evening, and will ease near midnight.</p>

### NOTES
Total Time: **40 minutes**

This run was a two-sided coin.

The good was that for the second run in a row, I did not have my typical ankle/soleus soreness.
<!---->
On the flip-side, the strides this afternoon were awkward, slow and **heavy legged**.  On top of that, I have seem to now have tender left, glute/hamstring/adductor that was felt _(only)_ during the strides.  The slow jog before and after the strides were pain free.  Exploring with a lacrosse ball after dinner revealed some very gnarly tissue in the belly of the hamstring and continuing in the piriformis.

This is a bit of a concern going into [tomorrow's workout](ironman2021-41weeksout).
