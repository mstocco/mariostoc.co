### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Up way too early for a rainy Sunday (0520).

While the rain came down this morning, I was able to get about 4 hours of work in.

I can feel a bit of yesterday's mountain bike ride in my shoulders.  It had been some time since I tried to pedal up a steep hill on a trail it seems.  My right ankle is still mildly sore (feels like a bit of a sprain) but not as sore as when I went to bed last night.

I had a pretty solid nap from around 1645 to 1800 too (more of those please).

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 21 minutes.  
Ride 2:00- 2:30 on MTB. Goose or Great trail would be a good route. Easy effort. Spending a longer amount of time in the saddle. Bring calories and water. Stay well fueled. Keep your effort even all ride.

### NOTES
Total Time: **130 minutes**

Sadly, the scale confirmed that the weight is still being packed on.  79.9 Kg is the heaviest single day number I've seen in years.

Making good on my promise to myself, I worked Sunday and took the afternoon off in lieu.  I wanted to take the XC bike out but I did a poor job mounting the tires on Saturday, resulting in a nasty, out of round tire that wasn't going to work for a +2 hour ride.  I started to work on it but no joy. probably the proprietary Bontrager rim.

With limited daylight, this is the wrong time of year to be _"pretend mechanic"_.  I pulled the road bike off the wall.

I headed west and did loop that included _Happy Valley Road_.   I felt **pretty good** today.  The weather was really nice when I left home, but was gloomier through Langford.  If I would have taken _The Great Trail_ north, I likely would have been wet.  I wore _"shoulder season kit"_ half way through December so...  it was a good ride.

I ate a dozen ju-jubes and most of a bottle of lemonade (~300 cals).
