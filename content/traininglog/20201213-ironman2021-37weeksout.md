Week beginning [Sunday, December 13, 2020](javascript:flick('sun');)

## SUMMARY
I feel like was...    
<sup>(completed at the end of the week)</sup>

## SUNDAY DEC 13 üåß
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Family commitments and terrible weather means I am pushing today's ride to [tomorrow afternoon](javascript:flick('mon');).

Mobility: 22 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Up way too early for a rainy Sunday (0520).

While the rain came down this morning, I was able to get about 4 hours of work in.

I can feel a bit of yesterday's mountain bike ride in my shoulders.  It had been some time since I tried to pedal up a steep hill on a trail it seems.  My right ankle is still mildly sore (feels like a bit of a sprain) but not as sore as when I went to bed last night.

I had a pretty solid nap from around 1645 to 1800 too (more of those please).

## MONDAY DEC 14 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 21 minutes.  
Ride 2:00- 2:30 on MTB. Goose or Great trail would be a good route. Easy effort. Spending a longer amount of time in the saddle. Bring calories and water. Stay well fueled. Keep your effort even all ride.

### NOTES
Total Time: **130 minutes**

Sadly, the scale confirmed that the weight is still being packed on.  79.9 Kg is the heaviest single day number I've seen in years.

Making good on my promise to myself, I worked Sunday and took this afternoon off in lieu.  I wanted to take the XC bike out but I did a poor job mounting the tires on Saturday, resulting in a nasty, out of round tire that wasn't going to work for a +2 hour ride.  I started to work on it but no joy (probably the proprietary Bontrager rim).  
<!---->
With limited daylight, this is the wrong time of year to be _"pretend mechanic"_.  I pulled the road bike off the wall.

I headed west and did loop that included _Happy Valley Road_.   I felt **pretty good** today.  The weather was really nice when I left home, but was gloomier through Langford.  If I would have taken _The Great Trail_ north, I likely would have been wet.  I wore _"shoulder season kit"_ half way through December so...  it was a good ride.

I ate a dozen ju-jubes and most of a bottle of lemonade (~300 cals).

## TUESDAY DEC 15 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Bike 60 minutes: 40 minutes easy spinning. 8x 1:00 high cadence, 1:00 easy after each. 4 minutes easy to finish up.   
OTB: Run 40 minutes flat and easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **99 minutes**

Wide awake at 0515 but I did go back to bed and get another hour of sleep.  This was a long day at work and it meant getting into the garage for a ride on the rollers at 1830.

The ride felt a bit sluggish in the first minute but once I was up to temperature, it was all systems go.  I watched the replay of the bike leg of the _Daytona Challenge_ and it weirdly felt like it was me and a bunch of friends out for a ride in aero.  I was on the bullhorns for the cadence work though.  I had a bottle of lemonade with me and I got most of it down before the ride ended.

I felt **pretty good** on the bike tonight.
### HEART RATE ON THE BIKE

---
I had my night run kit with me in the garage and I wasn't long off the bike before I was alone in the dark, plodding on the _Lochside Trail_ heading toward _Quadra Avenue_.  Everything was nice and easy on the outbound leg (minus the initial jelly legs) but when I reached the turnaround, I realized how much of a tailwind I had been running with.  I also started to feel really hungry; I was just 19 minutes before I would be home and at the dinner table.  This was a good, niggle free, slow run off the bike and **just what I needed** on a day like today.

After a late dinner, I had a somewhat large, emergency task to do for work.  Sadly, it took longer than expected and I sent my last email at 0137 and was in bed by 0200.

I had an emergency project that kept me up until 0200 last night and when I finally did get to bed, I woke up with night sweats and a way too early trip to the bathroom.  Frustrating indeed but I have a plan...
<!---->
First call at work this morning was at 0830 and I did have a few hours of productivity.  Looking out the window I could see that there was a calm before the storm so I took advantage of the weather window to go for an easy run.

I knew that 50 minutes would put me between 8 and 9 kms and when I set out, I felt **really good**; zero aches or pains.  I immediately promised myself to make this run feel as good at the 8 km mark as it did at during the first kilometre.  In fact, I did just that.  I just plodded along at what I thought was very consistent 6:30/km pace and when the watch showed 8km, I was feeling as good as I did on that first km.  I was surprised to have run 5:50/km overall too.  This was a bread and butter run and I felt like I nailed it.

### 8.88 KM OF EASY RUNNING

Considering I had a garbage sleep last night I needed to look after myself.  So later in the afternoon, I put the computer away and put my head down for a solid **one hour nap**.

There wasn't a swim workout specified for today so I chose to repeat a [previously written workout](ironman2021-43weeksout?sat).  I felt a bit anxious because I couldn't reserve a space _moderate lane_; this would be my first time in any _fast lane_.

Honestly, there wasn't a reason to feel self-conscious about being in the _fast lane_; it was me, another guy with similar fitness, one _really slow_ person and one woman that really knew what she was doing.  After 30 minutes, the other swimmers were done and I had the whole space to myself.  I finished the 1900m workout with plenty of time on the clock so I did another easy 3x100m.

## THURSDAY DEC 17 üå§
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 25 minutes.   
Bike 80 minutes: 20 minutes easy spinning. 4x (:20, :40, 1:00 high cadence, :40 easy after each) 3:00 easy. 6x 3:00 w/ moderately strong pressure on the pedals, something you could hold for 40-50 minutes. 2:00 easy spinning after each. Easy spinning to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 minutes**

I had the most restful sleep of the week so far but I did not get the quantity of sleep that I think I need.  Calves and achilles (both) are mildly tender to the touch.  Today is looking like a decent weather day before what is forecast for the weekend.

After a big spaghetti dinner, I got out to the garage late for the ride.  I did feel a bit more fatigue that lasted further into the workout then the bike workout on [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');).  I did wear my race kit to see if the forward tip of my saddle had a positive effect on the comfort of the suit.  It did help a bit but on further inspection of the suit, its chamois wasn't sewn in with much care.  I think it is repairable.

## FRIDAY DEC 18 üåß
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
21 Minute Cyclist Flexibility Routine.   

Run 60 minutes. Flat to rolling terrain. Easy effort. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

This might have been the best sleep that I had so far this week as I woke feeling rested.

From morning coffee to the keyboard, I had another long but productive day at work.  Unfortunately, that meant I missed a nice and dry, daylight period to get outside for today's run.  

It was a dark and rainy night with a gore-tex jacket, a hi-vis vest and a some of mental coaxing to get out the door.
<!---->
I read stories of other people that have set out and completed what I am working toward and almost everybody has that same story about running during miserable weather on some dark, winter night, and how it was those times that helped them build the fortitude to keep going when times get tough.  It was dark and the rain was coming down but I **enjoyed the moment** too much for this to be a fortitude building experience.

I am starting to feel the time on my feet as it is getting close to the end of the week.
