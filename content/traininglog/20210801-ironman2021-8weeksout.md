# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, August 1, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**8 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Start of the big push to the end.  I think I can handle this.  My goal is to stretch, roll and stay on top of the maintenance work to get me to the start line intact.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **STAYING CONSISTENT**.

By far the largest volume of training that I have completed to date; **17 HOURS**.

Maybe the biggest tell for where I am at is the [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');) ride, 3 days after the hills of Sunday's ride.  Despite the mistakes made on Wednesday, my legs were better than expected and I was able to run comfortably off the bike too.  Good things are happening.

Work was super busy and had added pressure this week.  I am expecting the same next week unfortunately too.

## SUNDAY AUG 1 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 4:00 on TT bike. Try to get in some longer climbs. Heading up the Malahat, Mt. Matheson road, Neild Road, or Gold Stream heights would (roads you can actually pedal up the whole climb) would be great. Trying to get in at least one longer climb, and as many as 3.  
Fueling: Minimum of 300 calories an hour. Stay hydrated.  
Trying to drink enough that you need a few pee breaks.  

Overall effort....steady. Use your gears on the climbs, keep things moving everywhere else, but never pressing too hard. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **236 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **81 km**

Up the _Malahat_ for this afternoon's ride.  This would be a great highway to ride if it wasn't for the billions of stones littering the shoulder.
<!---->
It was hot too!  The first climb up _Tunnnel Hill_ was a slog; my heart rate was high 140s to low 150s; meaning I was working harder than I wanted.  I wasn't _"on the gas"_, it was just hotter than the last time I rode up this hill.

Rinse repeat for the leg up the past _West Shawnigan Lake Road_.  Just before the summit, I headed up to the _Villa Eyrie Resort_ and down the backside of _Ebedora Lane_.  That gave me another hill to climb to get back to the resort; it was steep enough for me to stop in the resort parking lot for a breather, to switch out bottles and to review where I was heading next.  As soon as I stopped, I found myself soaked with sweat.

This was my first time up into _Goldstream Heights_; a subdivision above the Malahat.  Nice, quiet roads with brief views of _Victoria_ and _Haro Strait_ made the long hill seem almost worth the effort.  In the heat, it was a grunt for me to get up with a 34x25.

I added a couple of comparitively smaller hills to the ride once back in _Langford_ before heading home.

Pretty standard fueling with 3 bottles of Lemondade mix supplimented with Maynards Peach Fuzz candy on the day.

#### WEIRD NOTE
I noticed a shotgun shell, neatly placed primer end down, on the shoulder near the top of _Tunnel Hill_ while on my way back into town.  When I got to the bottom of _Goldstream_, I pulled over to call it in to the RCMP.  They sent an officer back up the hill and they did retrieve the shell.

Late morning start took me down to the _Songhees Walkway_, then through _Esquimalt_ and finally back along the _Gorge Waterway_.   I felt good pretty much the entire run too.  Just a nice easy rhythm and taking in the sunshine.

No PR set on the ride to the pool today and once in the water, I could feel the effects from the long weekend.

The 60 minute ride after the pool was felt as well and I effectively rode around, into Esquimalt looking for mostly flat roads to pedal.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I didn't run immediately off the bike but after putting my bike away, getting changed and a large glass of water, I set off for the run.  I felt better than good.  I took the bike path toward _Quadra Street_, turning around at 15:18 and perfectly spliting the run with a 30:36 time; pace was around 5:40/km.  I am pretty happy with the numbers but even more, just feel good period.

I had an errand to run at Uptown and I took my road bike.  From there, I rode the mostly bike path loop up to _Wale Road_ then double ping back through _Esquimalt_.

My energy was low after work today.  The weather was cloudy with a gusty SW wind.

### NOTES

Whether I was subconsciously procrastinating or I just felt like I needed some time for myself, I got out the door late in the afternoon for today's workout.  To drag things out more, I drove out to _Matheson Lake_ instead of going to _Elk Lake_.  The winds from the west had picked up and I was taking a chance by going out to the East Sooke area (westerloes are typically strongest out that way).
