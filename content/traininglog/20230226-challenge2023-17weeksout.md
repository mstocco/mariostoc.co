### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Pre-Bike: Dead bugs, Glute Bridges.  
Ride 80 minutes easy. Just spin. Trainer or rollers. Whatever sounds fun.

2nd: Run 50 minutes EASY. Ideally this is off the bike. But whatever works with the schedule works with me.

### NOTES
Total Time: **130 Mins** &nbsp; Run: **8km** &nbsp; NP: **118W**

Wedding expo first, then the run, then the spin.

Impending weather and daylight was my motivation to run first.  My **legs felt heavy** right away; no choice but to run easy up to [Panama Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);) and back.    I had a gel ~30 minutes in.

I was on the trainer shortly after; **tired legs** for this activity too.  I had a bottle with 70g of carb mix consumed in the first hour, and just water for the last 20 minutes.

Pasta dinner flowed the ride.
