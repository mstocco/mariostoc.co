<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Pre-Bike: Dead bugs, Glute Bridges.  
Ride 80 minutes easy. Just spin. Trainer or rollers. Whatever 
sounds fun.

2nd: Run 50 minutes EASY. Ideally this is off the bike. But 
whatever works with the schedule works with me.

### NOTES
Total Time: **130 Mins** &nbsp; Run: **8km** &nbsp; NP: **118W**

Wedding expo first, then the run, then the spin.

Impending weather and daylight was my motivation to run first. 
My **legs felt heavy** right away; no choice but to run easy 
up to [Panama Hill](javascript:flkty.select(2);) and back. 
I had a gel ~30 minutes in.

I was on the trainer shortly after; **tired legs** for this 
activity too.  I had a bottle with 70g of carb mix consumed in 
the first hour, and just water for the last 20 minutes.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Run: Dead bugs, breathing, and Glute Bridges.
Run 60 minutes EASY. 

Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **62 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **10.2 km**

Not the most restful sleep last night.  Regardless, everything 
is just a **little bit better** today.

Shovelled some heavy snow before work then late this afternoon, 
I went for the easy run.

What a difference from [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');). 
Practically the same route, same time of day, same kind of 
weather, except today, everything felt far more **comfortable**. 
I could still feel the knot in my left glute and there is some 
soreness in my right talo-navicular joint. Regardless, for a 
regular, base run, I finished it with a big smile.
<!----->
Reviewing the activity afterwards, I would have guessed that 
my pace was quicker than it was.  No matter, my focus was 
running with good posture, not going fast.

Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Bike: Dead bugs, Glute Bridges.

Trainer 95 minutes: Remember to hydrate and fuel!
15 minutes easy spinning to warm up.
8x :30 moderate standing, getting out of the saddle to loosen up, :45 seated/normal riding.
5 minutes easy spinning.
6x 1:00 high cadence/stable hips, 1:30 easy spinning after each.
3 extra minutes easy spinning.
5x 6 minutes @ what feels like 1 gear easier than a 60 minute effort (aka: Find 60 minute effort..then drop it a gear easier and tick away) 2 minutes easy after each rep.
7 minutes easy spinning to cool down.

### NOTES
Time: **94 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **137W**

Awake at 0400.  Fortunately, I was able to get another hour of 
sleep after a while.
<!----->
Back on the trainer late in the afternoon.  I need to remember 
the order in which to turn on the electronics to get the right 
device to control the _"smart trainer"_.

Dead bugs and glute bridges first as I can still feel that 
left hip flexor not as strong/healthy as it should be.  Once 
pedalling, it is not bothered.

I continued with the 2019 coverage of _Challenge Roth_ on 
YouTube.  The top men have started the run; LCB has crested 
_Solar Hill_ on her final lap.

I lost a minute of saddle time for a bio-break.

Run 45 minutes EASY. Running home from the pool, on the treadmill, or another time of tday. It all works for me.

### NOTES
Time: **108 Mins** &nbsp; Swim(s): **2300m** &nbsp; Run(s): **9 km**

The cough has started to subside and my resting heartrate is 
close to pre-COVID numbers.
<!----->
Commute to the pool on foot for 3.8 km _"warm up"_; I felt pretty good; effort was easy. Even a solid hail storm couldn't wreck my **good mood**.

---

In the pool, I knew I only had a limited amount of time with the 50m lanes in.  I made the most of it and got through to the end of the 9x50m descend set.  **Effort was good**, focus was on point.  My friend Batuhan was in the lane beside me and that helped with the motivation.

I hopped out and re-worked the workout in my watch to work with the 25m lanes.  It wasn't long before I was back in the water to do the hard 50m set.  Even the shorter lengths couldn't help me from **feeling gassed** on the hard efforts.

---

On the longer jog home, I dealt with a side stitch for the longest time.  It eventually passed and the final kilometres were **easy and rhythmic**.

---

Although the 2 workouts were broken up over 4 activities, this was a solid afternoon.   My left hip complex finished up ok.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Ride: Dead bugs, Glute Bridges.

Trainer 80 minutes: 
20 minutes easy spinning to warm up. 
3 rounds (:10, :20, :30, :40, :50 high cadence on 1:00. 5 minutes easy spinning after each round) 
5x 2:00 big gear/low cadence/high torque...again, no watt range, just ride to feel tension on the pedals and a comfortable position. 2:00 easy spinning after each. 
10 minutes easy spinning to cool down. 

Mobility 18 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **143W**

Just as I am about to get ahead of one niggle (left hip) another pops up.  I woke up this morning with an angry rhomboid major (right side).
<!----->
Fortunately, that rhomboid isn't needed much while turning my legs over on the trainer.

I rode the workout exactly as written, holding 120 RPM on the first rounds and averaging 50 RPM on the big gear reps.  I continued with the 2019 Roth coverage on YouTube; the men's leader has turned off the canal and is making his way back to town.  The clock on him was ~06:45:00; depending on the start wave that I am assigned in June, I may not see the leader on the run course.
