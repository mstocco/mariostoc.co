## SUNDAY JAN 17 üå§
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 1:30. Flat route. Easy effort. Maybe get yourself onto some dirt for part of it. (not mandatory, but doesn't hurt) 

2nd: (Timing is up to you) Ride 60 minutes. Any bike. Keep the effort EASY. Can be inside or outside. This is basically your spin out after the longer run.

### NOTES
Total Time: **145 minutes** &nbsp; Run: **10 miles**

I don't think I slept all that well as I was very groggy this morning.  I am a bit stiff too.

The question for me today is, how do I follow up a solid ride from [yesterday](ironman2021-33weeksout?sat), while still feeling that ride in my legs?

The answer is to go out and have an even better run on Sunday!
<!---->
Carina dropped me off at _Mitchell Farm_ on her way to _Sidney_; that should put me at 90 minutes away from home on a flat route with sections of dirt road.  My right ankle barked on my first step, and _only_ my first step; it was solid for the remainder of the run.  In fact, everything felt solid today.

The story I couldn't wait to get home and write started just south of _Royal Oak Avenue_.  3 guys, all half my age, had gathered along the side of the trail.  As I went past, I heard them talk about the run they were planing to do.  

It was maybe a minute down the trail when I heard their footsteps.  The first guy went by me at what I guessed to be 5 min/km and his two friends were a touch slower.  I am feeling good and with quicker people ahead me, I decided to match pace with the slower two.

That pace lasted for maybe a kilometre for the two ahead of me.  The gap that they put into me was gone and their effort fell off.  Not only was the first guy putting the hurt on these two, I don't think they were happy being caught either.

<!---->
The fastest of the these 3 was further up the trail but had stopped to wait for his buddies.  He was looking at his friends still down the trail with a dejected disposition as I went past.

I held the effort through to the _Monkey Tree Pub_ but really, I felt good right through to _Pearkes Arena_ where I did a lap of the parking lot to get to 90 minutes and 10 miles even.  I felt like had lots more in the tank at the end too.

### NORMALIZED KILOMETRE PACES
![Pace Graph](/assets/jpg/pacing-20210117.jpeg)

The bike really had not much to report.  I watched the 4th quarter of the _Tampa Bay vs New Orleans_ game.  I stopped 5 minutes short of the hour to roll out my hamstrings and piriformis.

The swim went ok.  Two things of note:  I did get a pretty good chlorine burn in my right eye; uncomfortable but not a show-stopper.  The other being my right ankle was not happy with the kicking tonight.  On the 6th of 6 rounds, I replaced that last kickboard rep with just a 50m swim because my ankle was pretty aggravated.

A bit of a restless sleep and I am stiff and sore this morning.  I think an hour on the massage chair is in order today.

Today was cooler but sunny so the indoor ride was replaced with a clockwise loop of the waterfront.  It might have been easier to ride in the gargage.  Nice weather but my quads had very little to give.

I did ride with for a bit with another trackie; cool!

### GOLDEN HOUR RIDE, KING GEORGE TERRACE
![King George Terrace](/assets/jpg/ridepic-20210119.jpeg)

The run was a slightly lengthened jog out to _Quadra Street_ via the bike path.  Again, no juice in the legs and if I had a chance to do this over, I probably would have cut this short to 30 minutes.  Fiblaris longus tendon, behind the lateral malleolus (to be specific) was not happy; so same ankle that I was complaining about recently except the tendon running behind the outer ankle bone instead of in front of it.

I am feeling last weekend tonight.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
*5 minute warm up/loosen up before the run*  
Run 65 minutes easy on rolling to hilly terrain.   
Mobility 22 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **62 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **9.9 km**

After a so-so sleep last night, it was a 4 appendage effort to get out of bed this morning.  Good news is the first steps of the day were pain free for my right ankle but the rest of the body is stiff.

My right ankle did ok on the run tonight but maybe it was that the rest of me was feeling a bit beat up that made that ankle feel not so bad...

With the intension of doing my typical _Craigflower Loop_, I needed to find another ~20 minutes to make up the difference for tonight's total time.  As I got to _Gorge Road_, I made a left thinking that I could join up with _Craigflower Road_ further south and finish my loop with some added time.  Once I got to the _Selkirk Trestle_ though, the night couldn't have been more perfect for a cruise along the shoreline; that's what I did and it was awesome.  The windless night made for a perfect reflections of the city lights on the water of the _Upper and Outer Harbour_.

I got to _Head Street_ and climbed up from there.  My thought was the hill would add to the "hiily terrain" component but in reviewing the activity, there wasn't as much elevation gain as I typically get on hilly course.  Just the same, I am left feeling like I did more than 10km and I am looking forward a day off from running.
