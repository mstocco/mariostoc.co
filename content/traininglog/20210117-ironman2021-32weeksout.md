## SUNDAY JAN 17
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 1:30. Flat route. Easy effort. Maybe get yourself onto some dirt for part of it. (not mandatory, but doesn't hurt) 

2nd: (Timing is up to you) Ride 60 minutes. Any bike. Keep the effort EASY. Can be inside or outside. This is basically your spin out after the longer run.

### NOTES
Total Time: **145 minutes** &nbsp;Run Distance: **10 miles**

I don't think I slept all that well as I was very groggy this morning.  I am a bit stiff too.

The question for me today is how do I follow up a solid ride from [yesterday](ironman2021-33weeksout?sat), while feeling that ride in my legs?

The answer is to have an even better run on Sunday!

Carina dropped me off at _Mitchell Farm_ on her way to _Sidney_; that should put me at 90 minutes away from home on a flat route with sections of dirt road.  My right ankle barked on my first step, and _only_ my first step; it was solid for the remainder of the run.  In fact, everything felt solid today.

The story I couldn't wait to get home and write started just south of _Royal Oak Avenue_.  3 guys, all half my age, had gathered along the side of the trail.  As I went past, I heard them talk about the run they were planing to do.  

It was maybe a minute down the trail when I heard their footsteps.  The first guy went by me at what I guessed to be about sub-5 min/km and his two friends were a touch slower.  So I am feeling good and with quicker people just ahead me, I decided to match pace with the slower two.

That pace lasted a just a few minutes for the two guys ahead of me.  The gap that they put into me was gone and their effort fell right off.  No only was the first guy putting the hurt on these two, I don't think they were happy being caught by me.

The fastest of the these 3 was further up the trail but had stopped to wait for his buddies.  He was looking at his friends still down the trail with a dejected disposition as I went past.

I held the effort through to the _Monkey Tree Pub_ but really, I felt good right through to _Pearkes Arena_ where I did a lap of the parking lot to get to 90 minutes and 10 miles even.  I felt like had lots more in the tank at the end too.

The bike really had not much to report.  I watched the 4th quarter of the _Tampa Bay_ v _New Orleans_ game.  I stopped 5 minutes short of the hour to roll out my hamstrings and piriformis.
