# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 17, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**32 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I have a good streak going so far this January.  My goal for this week is to keep that momentum going and to stay on top of a couple of niggles.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

## SUNDAY JAN 17
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 1:30. Flat route. Easy effort. Maybe get yourself onto some dirt for part of it. (not mandatory, but doesn't hurt) 

2nd: (Timing is up to you) Ride 60 minutes. Any bike. Keep the effort EASY. Can be inside or outside. This is basically your spin out after the longer run.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I don't think I slept all that well as I was very groggy this morning.  I am a bit stiff too.

The question for me today is how do I follow up a solid ride from [yesterday](ironman2021-33weeksout?sat), while feeling that ride in my legs?  The answer is to have an even better run on Sunday!
