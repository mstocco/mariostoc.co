# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 17, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**32 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I have a good streak going so far this January.  My goal for this week is to keep that momentum going and to stay on top of a couple of niggles.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **SURFING THE WHOLE WAVE**

From peak to trough, this week had it all.  The week started with a solid [long run](javascript:flick('sun');) (peak) and ended with a 3 hour ride on fatigued legs (trough).  This week also saw the [end of my streak](javascript:flick('fri');) of 22 consecutive days of at least one workout.  It was a week was just shy of **12 hours** of training.

Work/life balance was a bit harder this week; I did have to spend more time on the keyboard than normal.

The week ended with some memories of my dad.  I am not anywhere near over the loss of him.

## SUNDAY JAN 17 üå§
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 1:30. Flat route. Easy effort. Maybe get yourself onto some dirt for part of it. (not mandatory, but doesn't hurt) 

2nd: (Timing is up to you) Ride 60 minutes. Any bike. Keep the effort EASY. Can be inside or outside. This is basically your spin out after the longer run.

### NOTES
Total Time: **145 minutes** &nbsp; Run: **10 miles**

I don't think I slept all that well as I was very groggy this morning.  I am a bit stiff too.

The question for me today is, how do I follow up a solid ride from [yesterday](ironman2021-33weeksout?sat), while still feeling that ride in my legs?

The answer is to go out and have an even better run on Sunday!
<!---->
Carina dropped me off at _Mitchell Farm_ on her way to _Sidney_; that should put me at 90 minutes away from home on a flat route with sections of dirt road.  My right ankle barked on my first step, and _only_ my first step; it was solid for the remainder of the run.  In fact, everything felt solid today.

The story I couldn't wait to get home and write started just south of _Royal Oak Avenue_.  3 guys, all half my age, had gathered along the side of the trail.  As I went past, I heard them talk about the run they were planing to do.  

It was maybe a minute down the trail when I heard their footsteps.  The first guy went by me at what I guessed to be 5 min/km and his two friends were a touch slower.  I am feeling good and with quicker people ahead me, I decided to match pace with the slower two.

That pace lasted for maybe a kilometre for the two ahead of me.  The gap that they put into me was gone and their effort fell off.  Not only was the first guy putting the hurt on these two, I don't think they were happy being caught either.

<!---->
The fastest of the these 3 was further up the trail but had stopped to wait for his buddies.  He was looking at his friends still down the trail with a dejected disposition as I went past.

I held the effort through to the _Monkey Tree Pub_ but really, I felt good right through to _Pearkes Arena_ where I did a lap of the parking lot to get to 90 minutes and 10 miles even.  I felt like had lots more in the tank at the end too.

### NORMALIZED KILOMETRE PACES
![Pace Graph](/assets/jpg/pacing-20210117.jpeg)

The bike really had not much to report.  I watched the 4th quarter of the _Tampa Bay vs New Orleans_ game.  I stopped 5 minutes short of the hour to roll out my hamstrings and piriformis.

The swim went ok.  Two things of note:  I did get a pretty good chlorine burn in my right eye; uncomfortable but not a show-stopper.  The other being my right ankle was not happy with the kicking tonight.  On the 6th of 6 rounds, I replaced that last kickboard rep with just a 50m swim because my ankle was pretty aggravated.

A bit of a restless sleep and I am stiff and sore this morning.  I think an hour on the massage chair is in order today.

Today was cooler but sunny so the indoor ride was replaced with a clockwise loop of the waterfront.  It might have been easier to ride in the gargage.  Nice weather but my quads had very little to give.

I did ride with for a bit with another trackie; cool!

### GOLDEN HOUR RIDE, KING GEORGE TERRACE
![King George Terrace](/assets/jpg/ridepic-20210119.jpeg)

The run was a slightly lengthened jog out to _Quadra Street_ via the bike path.  Again, no juice in the legs and if I had a chance to do this over, I probably would have cut this short to 30 minutes.  Fiblaris longus tendon, behind the lateral malleolus (to be specific) was not happy; so same ankle that I was complaining about recently except the tendon running behind the outer ankle bone instead of in front of it.

I can feel the workouts from last weekend.

After a so-so sleep last night, it was a 4 appendage effort to get out of bed this morning.  Good news is the first steps of the day were pain free for my right ankle but the rest of the body is stiff.

My right ankle did ok on the run tonight but maybe it was that the rest of me was feeling a bit beat up that made that ankle feel not so bad...

With the intension of doing my typical _Craigflower Loop_ plus a bit more, I needed figure out that "bit more" and find another 20 minutes to make tonight's alloted total time.
<!---->
At _Gorge Road_, I had an idea thinking that I could join up with _Craigflower Road_ further south and continue with my loop and some added time.  Once I got to the _Selkirk Trestle_ though, I abandoned that plan.  This night couldn't have been more perfect for a cruise along the shoreline; it was dark, meditative and awesome.  The windless night made for a perfect reflections of the city lights on the water of the _Upper and Outer Harbour_.  I feel lucky to call this place home.

At the end of the _Songhess Walkway_, I headed up _Head Street_; my thought was the hill would add to tonight's "hiily terrain" component.  After reviewing the activity, there wasn't as much elevation change as I thought.  Regardless, my body  feels like it did more than 10km of hills.

## THURSDAY JAN 21 ‚òÅÔ∏è

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Total Time: **117 minutes**

Amazing what a good night sleep will do.  My feet hit the floor this morning with more engergy than the past few days.

<!---->
At the pool, I was in Esquimalt's_"Fast Lane"_ for the second time.  I think I am over the mental hesitation of booking this lane.  I haven't seen the crowd that occupies the fast lane at _Crystal Pool_.  This workout, along with the swim on [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');), flowed well with everyone around me.

Swimming 2200m is an easy ask by itself but I was challenged with the shorter, 10 second rests during the 8x25 sets.  I felt a good upper body _"pump"_ after this swim (like I had just left the gym).

The ride on the trainer was uneventful and I had an Elite Men's XCO race on in the background.  The garage was noticeably colder tonight, even with the fan on its _lowest_ setting.

_"All good things come to and end."_

The streak is over and to be honest, I am feeling ok about it.  This was a long day on the keyboard and even though it was sunny, I more felt more motivated to finish a project for work than I did to go outside.  The procrastination to go for a run meant that be the time I was finished work, it was dark, dinner time and it was colder than normal outside.  Zero motivation to lace up the sneakers.

Instead, I cooked dinner with Carina and spent the evening with a lacrosse ball focusing on some tender quads and hamstrings.

Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **197 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **80 km**

Another January day with dry roads and that means I am on the road bike.  My ride [last Saturday](/ironman2021-33weeksout?sat) was close to 3 hours so it was a no brainer to do another ride out to _Lands End Road_.  This week, I reversed the direction of the route and rode it clockwise.  I also included the punchy, _Prospect Lake Road_ into the early part of the route.
<!---->
I felt a fatigued in my quads right from the start and the _Prospect Lake_ idea did not help to get me into the groove that I thought it would.  This was a _"soldier on"_ effort from start to finish as I did not feel anywhere near as fresh as a week ago.  The twinge in my piriformis didn't appear until the second hour this week (an improvement) and I really only noticed it once (_Mt. Newton X-Road_ area).

### Calories and fluids
I packed 36 jujubes and consumed 32 (~530 calories).  I also upped the concentration of Gatorade in my bottles from 53g to 66g (~250 calories each) and consumed a litre (~300 calories).  No GI today though I can hear the talk I may get of next Thursday regarding just 1 litre of fluid.  This did meet the goal of minimum 200 calories per hour at around 275 cals/hour.  I could do more if it was warmer.

Before bed, my legs had a nice ache going; stimulus received.
