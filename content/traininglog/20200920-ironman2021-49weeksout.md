## SUNDAY SEP 20
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes  
Ride 1:30-1:45. Flatter ride on the road bike. 
If your MTB is up and rolling, I'm very much ok with this being an 80-90 minute fun MTB ride on some dirt roads/trails.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 minutes**

There was an option for a MTB ride an I took it after an inspection of the front wheel on the road bike.  Before I headed out, I had a flat to repair; that caused a nasty gash across 2 fingers.  Grrrr...

I headed out toward Thetis without much of a plan except to be out for 90 minutes.  The park was busy with people.  I skipped my favourite single track and took the fire road to the base of Mount Stewart.  By that point, I had been pedalling for 40 minutes.  
<!---->
From the base, I walked my bike up the steep sections until I got to the summit. After a bit of time soaking in the sunshine, I headed back down to Scafe Hill, then to Bellamy and the fireroad route out of Thetis Lake Park.

I took it easy as I am naturally fatigued from yesterday’s effort.  This was **a really fun ride** and as the trails are dry (for now)

## MONDAY SEP 21
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 20 minutes  
Run 30 minutes. Flat and easy 

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

I had a so-so sleep last night even though the Seahawk beat the Patriots with a defensive stand on the last play.  I am particularly tight in my left hip and need time with the lacrosse ball to get the tissue to calm down.

I did a lap of Swan Lake.  I walked for 5 minutes before hitting start on the watch, jogged for 31 minutes and walked for five minutes after.  I picked the trail over the road because I am more sore today than I was yesterday.  My motivation wasn't all that high but I remembered my goal of getting all the workouts in this week and out the door I went.  I am glad I did too because the rain is coming, likely tomorrow.

## TUESDAY SEP 22
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 45 minutes. Easy spinning. Nothing too hard.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes**

I slept well last night and woke up feeling rested though I do have some lingering soreness from last weekend.

The workout today called for rollers but I was done work early and the weather was nice so I prepped the TT Bike and went for a spin.  I figured if I was scheduled for 45 minutes on the rollers, I should be looking at a little longer than an hour outside and not on an overly hilly route.  I headed out to Langford before looping back through Esquimalt.

This was the first ride on the TT bike since Elk Lake in August and it **felt really good**.

## MY 49TH BIRTHDAY
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 15 minutes  
Run 30 minutes flat and easy.

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

Another night with a restful sleep.  I am still a bit tight through the hips and piriformis.  I'll roll out well before heading out on my jog.

So the **rain** is here.  I headed out for a 30 minute jog to the center of the trestle and back.  The effort was scheduled as easy and for the most part, it was; my breathing was easy and my focus was on running comfortably.  I ended with 30 minutes at **5:35/km** which seems like a touch fast (or the new normal).  If anything was complaining, it is the usual suspects of soleus and ankles but overall, this **felt better** than Monday's run.

## THURSDAY SEP 24
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Hilly road ride or Fun MTB ~ 75-90 minutes. Easy effort on the flats/downhills, more of a moderate effort on the uphills.

<p><span class="agencyvc">UPDATE:</span> I got the ok to ride the rollers tonight.</p>

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

A little _"vino rosso"_ at last night's birthday dinner may have made my sleep feel a bit off.  It is a rain day and I will need to play bike mechanic before heading out after work.


60 Minutes steady state on the rollers with an average RPM of 88 and tire pressure of 70 psi.  This was not a taxing effort on the lungs or legs and my sit bones are the only thing sore after this indoor spin.

## FRIDAY SEP 25
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 15 minutes  
Run 50 minutes: 30 minutes easy running to warm up. 8x :30 uphill strides a touch stronger than 5k effort, 1:00 easy downhill jog after each. 8 minutes easy running to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **85 minutes**

I think I slept well last night as I went to bed an hour earlier.

I had a work lunch that had me commute to Broadmead for &plusmn;30 minutes on the bike.

It seems like forever since my coach has put a structured run like this into my inbox but today was my lucky day.  I ran the strides up Islet Avenue which worked out perfectly for the 30 second efforts.  The warmup was a bit shorter and the cool down a bit longer; this run **felt good**.
