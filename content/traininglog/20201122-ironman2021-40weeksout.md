# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, November 22, 2020](javascript:flick('sun');)

**40 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am starting this week after doing this Sunday's workout [yesterday](ironman2021-41weeksout?sat).  That run has me thinking about the mental component to race efforts and what I can do to improve that as I prep for a 5K TT in 2 weeks.

## SUMMARY

### PLANNED WORKOUT 
Today's scheduled workout of a paced, 5000m run on a track was completed [yesterday](ironman2021-41weeksout?sat). 

### NOTES
I slept pretty soundly last night.  Regardless, both legs are feeling smoked (left more so than the right) so instead of a recovery run (or bike), Carina and I drove out to _East Sooke_ and did a walk/hike on the _Matheson Lake Trail_.  Chalk it down as 2 hours of **light activity** though the trail was a bit hilly on the south side of the lake.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 22 Minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 minutes**

Another good sleep last night and I am feeling pretty good overall.

I had a pretty deep work over with my lacrosse ball, focusing on two tender spots, both on my left leg.  My left hamstring and left adductor were angry and needed some attention.

With only light activity yesterday, I wanted to let get a little more out of today than just mobility and massage.  I put the 4th quarter of _Monday Night Football_ on the screen an peddled easy for 45 minutes; light pressure, low heart rate.  Alarm is set for tomorrow afternoon.
