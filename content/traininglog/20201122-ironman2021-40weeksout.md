# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning Sunday, November 22, 2020

**40 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am starting this week after doing this Sunday's workout [yesterday](ironman2021-41weeksout?sat).  That run has me thinking about the mental component to race efforts and what I can do to improve that as I prep for a 5K TT in 2 weeks.

## SUMMARY
I feel like was...

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT  
Morning: 5-15 minutes of basic mobility (of your choice) to loosen up for the day. 
Drive to the track (whatever track you like)  
10 minutes easy jogging. 6x 100 strides, Ideally @ a touch SLOWER than 5k speed. Yes, these are pretty slow. Goal is to warm up. 100 meter EASY jog between each.   
Then... 200 meters @ what you think you might hold for a 5k. Walk 200-400 meters. Bathroom, tighten shoes, water, ect.  
5k "Time Trial" We'll set goal lap splits and K splits on the 29th or 30th. Ideally this will be a bit SLOWER than a true Time trial.   
5 minutes walking. Then 10 minutes EASY jogging to cool down. 

### NOTES
Today's workout was run [yesterday](ironman2021-41weeksout?sat).

I slept pretty soundly last night.  The legs are feeling smoked from [yesterday](ironman2021-41weeksout?sat).
