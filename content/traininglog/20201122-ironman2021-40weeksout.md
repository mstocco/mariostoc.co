Morning: 5-15 minutes of basic mobility (of your choice) to loosen up for the day. 
Drive to the track (whatever track you like)  
10 minutes easy jogging. 6x 100 strides, Ideally @ a touch SLOWER than 5k speed. Yes, these are pretty slow. Goal is to warm up. 100 meter EASY jog between each.   
Then... 200 meters @ what you think you might hold for a 5k. Walk 200-400 meters. Bathroom, tighten shoes, water, ect.  
5k "Time Trial" We'll set goal lap splits and K splits on the 29th or 30th. Ideally this will be a bit SLOWER than a true Time trial.
