# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, November 22, 2020](javascript:flick('sun');)

**40 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am starting this week after doing this Sunday's workout [yesterday](ironman2021-41weeksout?sat).  That run has me thinking about the mental component to race efforts and what I can do to improve that as I prep for a 5K TT in 2 weeks.

## SUMMARY

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**

### PLANNED WORKOUT 
Today's scheduled workout of a paced, 5000m run on a track was completed [yesterday](ironman2021-41weeksout?sat). 

### NOTES
I slept pretty soundly last night.  Regardless, both legs are feeling smoked (left more so than the right) so instead of a recovery run (or bike), Carina and I drove out to _East Sooke_ and did a walk/hike on the _Matheson Lake Trail_.  Chalk it down as 2 hours of **light activity** though the trail was a bit hilly on the south side of the lake.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 22 Minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 minutes**

Another good sleep last night and I am feeling pretty good overall.

I had a pretty deep work over with my lacrosse ball, focusing on two tender spots, both on my left leg.  My left hamstring and left adductor were angry and needed some attention.

With only light activity yesterday, I wanted to let get a little more out of today than just mobility and massage.  I put the 4th quarter of _Monday Night Football_ on the screen an peddled easy for 45 minutes; light pressure, low heart rate.  

Alarm is set for tomorrow afternoon and getting back to the written schedule.

## TUESDAY NOV 24
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1:30pm Swim 2000: 2x (150 easy free, 3x 50 swim w/ buoy/strong finish to stroke r :20) 12x 100 Gradual descend 1-4, 5-8 w/ #4/8 @ an effort you could hold for 5-7 minutes. R :30 after each. 100 steady kick, 100 easy swim to cool down. 

Rollers 45 minutes. Keep it EASY

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 minutes**

Good sleep last night and I have a second eye on the clock for this afternoon's swim.

I should have asked how the _"gradual descend 1-4, 5-8"_ was to have taken place.  In lieu, I focused on hand-placement and kicking with straight legs over the course of the 12x100s.  This swim was **productive** otherwise.  Masks are now mandatory unless you are in the water; I am good with that.

The bike tonight was pretty straightforward, **uneventful pedalling** on the rollers.  I had a bike race on the screen; the commentary was in french so I turned the volume down and put on a podcast.  I don't think I paid much attention to either.  I just pedalled.

I feel like tonight I could have just as easily gone for a short, easy paced run but I do feel good about squaring up with the workout schedule.  

### IN OTHER NEWS
So my goal this week was to think about ways of **sharpening** my mental game, especially with a 5000m TT right in less than 2 weeks.  The _"Trainer Road Podcast"_ had a recent episode that took a dive into the autonomic nervous system; I took notes (of course I did) and then revisited [my comments](ironman2021-41weeksout?sat) from last Saturday's track session.

What I appended to my notes from [last Saturday](ironman2021-41weeksout?sat) feels like something to build on.
