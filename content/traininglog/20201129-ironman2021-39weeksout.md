### PLANNED WORKOUT

Really trying to figure out your pace and rhythm. 4:23-4:27 pace. Leaving on the 6:00. Walking around to stay loose between each effort. 10ish minutes easy jogging to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12 km**

Second restful sleep in a row (happy to have my pillow back).  I took an advil before bed to help with a stiff neck and it feels much better this morning.

After a drive to _PISE_ to find out the track was booked, it was back to _Oak Bay_ for today's workout.

I am not sure how to process this workout.  In the moment, I felt like I was running the 6x1000m at a hard but controlled pace.  I was generally on a 1:46/400m to start each rep and although I felt like I was steady with the same effort for the next 600m, the 1000m times were behind the target, mostly coming in on average 4:33/km.

The 4th and 5th rep had the sun peak out briefly and I was able to eke out a couple of seconds.  The last 1000m was more comfortable again with a building but controlled effort from 600m out.

So, was this workout a win because it was a total of 7km at slightly slower than a scheduled pace?  Or was this a miss because I was off target pace by 6 seconds except for the last one.

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 minutes**

Hit with insomnia last night, I think I remember seeing past 0300 on my watch.  I felt off most of the day today too.  I got more done at work than I expected regardless.

I generally don't have much to write about when it comes to a swim workout but tonight was **FUN!**    In particular, the 12x25m set, going strong on the odds.  I was really feeling it tonight knowing that I only had just 25 metres to the wall.  I know that for any real distance, these numbers are _"unsustainable"_ for where I am at and what I am ultimately trying to accomplish but trying to best my last effort became _"exhilarating"_.  The speed of the water rushing past felt different, the torque rotating from pull to pull felt powerful, the bow wake from the top of my head gave me a way bigger pocket of air to inhale from.  And my feet felt like they were fluttering at the surface.
