# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, November 29, 2020](javascript:flick('sun');)

**39 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
This week's focus is all about a **5000m TT** this [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) 

## SUMMARY
I feel like was **EMOTIONALLY READY** to run, but...

_‚ÄúA goal without a plan is just a wish.‚Äù_

So what happens when a goal with a plan is not realized?  I may be internalizing the results of [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');)   for a while.

## SUNDAY NOV 29 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 12 minutes.   
Run 75 minutes: 15 minutes easy to warm up. 10x 100 meter strides to loosen up/warm up, 100 meters very easy jogging between each. 6x 1000 meters @ 5k effort. Really trying to figure out your pace and rhythm. 4:23-4:27 pace. Leaving on the 6:00. Walking around to stay loose between each effort. 10ish minutes easy jogging to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12 km**

Second restful sleep in a row (happy to have my pillow back).  I took an advil before bed to help with a stiff neck and it feels much better this morning.

After a drive to _PISE_ to find out the track was booked, it was back to _Oak Bay_ for today's workout.
<!---->
I am not sure how to process this workout.  In the moment, I felt like I was running the 6x1000m at a hard but controlled pace.  I was generally on a 1:46/400m to start each rep and although I felt like I was steady with the same effort for the next 600m, the 1000m times were behind the target, mostly coming in on average 4:33/km.

The 4th and 5th rep had the sun peak out briefly and I was able to eke out a couple of seconds.  The last 1000m was more comfortable again with a building but controlled effort from 600m out.

So, was this workout a win because it was a total of 7km at slightly slower than a scheduled pace?  Or was this a miss because I was off target pace by 6 seconds except for the last one.

<h3 style="color:orange">Wind Warning for Greater Victoria</h3><p style="color:orange;border-top:1px solid orange;font-size:0.9em;">It's blowing the dog off the chain outside but no never mind b/c I am at the pool this afternoon (barring a power outage).</p>

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 minutes**

Hit with insomnia last night, I think I remember seeing past 0300 on my watch.  I _"felt off"_ most of the day today too.  Regardless, I still was able to have a productive work day.
<!---->
I generally don't have much to write about when it comes to a swim workout but tonight was **FUN!**    In particular, the 12x25m set, going strong on the odds.  I was really feeling it tonight knowing that I only had just 25 metres to the wall.

I know that for any real distance, these numbers are _"unsustainable"_ for where I am at and what I am ultimately trying to accomplish but trying to best my last effort became _"exhilarating"_.  The speed of the water rushing past felt different, the torque rotating from pull to pull felt powerful, the bow wake from the top of my head gave me a way bigger pocket of air to inhale from.  And my feet felt like they were fluttering at the surface.

## TUESDAY DEC 01 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **5**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes easy. Trainer or rollers. Keep it easy.   
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

A good sleep last night and a solid day on the keyboard too (@work).  I caught myself looking at the 5-day weather forecast with an eye on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');); it's almost like a _"race week"_.

I did the easy, flat run first while there was a bit of daylight left.  I headed down to the Gorge and did so gingerly; soleus (both legs) were more tender than usual.  I stopped for a traffic light and to take a picture for this week's training log page; so not 30 minutes of constant jogging but there was 33 minutes of moving time over 36 minutes total.
<!---->
It was a similar on the rollers in that I stopped for briefly to take some layers off, drink some Gatorade and after 40 minutes, a full on bathroom break.  Total time easy spinning was 60 minutes out of a 63 minute activity.

Speaking of Gatorade, that was a 500ml bottle with 200 calories consumed before and during the the time on the bike.

### BEAUTIFUL EVENING ALONG THE GORGE

10 minute cool down jog.

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes** &nbsp;  Feeling:  **Fantastic**

I slept in this morning.  The body is telling me I needed the rest.

Under the lights, post-sunset on the track; what a [beautiful night](javascript:flkty.select(2);) to be outside!  I executed the warm-up and found myself having to SLOW down the strides.  The 1400m effort went one more half lap to 1600m because I can't count and because I was **feeling a groove** hitting those 53/54s.

It was a coffee with some toast and jam after an okay sleep last night.  I drove to PISE at 0800 hoping to get the run completed before the soccer crowds showed up.
<!---->
Getting to the track, the place was empty, save two teenaged boys practicing penalty kicks on the soccer field.  This was a windless, crisp, 1¬∞C morning with a spectacular sunrise.  I was good to run, or so I thought.  The track had a couple of un-runable, icy sections; with the sun just above the horizon, it would take another hour before I could start.  I walked the track to pass the time.

Just after 9am, I started my warmup, paying particular attention to slowing down the 6x100m strides and nailing the speed on the 200m.  My watch read **52.4** seconds for that 200m length; right on schedule.

So the TT starts and I have it in my mind to no go out fast and I put the first 200m, 400m, 600m all at **54** seconds.  Everything is feeling light, easy and with a goal of running 53 second, 200m splits, I am only a touch behind schedule.  

I decided to pick it up a bit and I ran the next lap at 52 second 200m splits.  I was feeling really confident with how this run was shaping up.  Cadence, breathing, posture all felt familiar to the work I had been putting in.  
<!---->
I finished the 5th lap, 2000m into a 5000m effort and it hits; I was expecting it, but I was surprised that it happened so early.  The breakdown began; I went from cruising down the track to fighting for everything.  I was fighting to maintain pace, fighting to maintaine a race cadence.  I tried to force a smile, anything to change the direction that this outcome was heading toward.  

When I did this distance on [Halloween](ironman2021-44weeksout?sat), the breakdown hit around 4 km.  In fact, today sadly felt closer to [September 19th](ironman2021-50weeksout?sat) where I didn't even get to 5km than any other day in between.

Today's reality: **4:37 min/km** for **23:07**   

<!---->
The ride was scheduled for 30 minutes indoors but with the weather being what it is, I took the road bike out for a flat spin around the Goose/E&N bike path loop.
