# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, February 13, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**28** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Put together another big week

## SUMMARY
Total Time: Just shy of **10 Hours**

I feel like I was **BUILDING UP**

Fatigue wast felt on the run [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');) and again on [Friday](javascript:flick('fri');) but every other day this week was above average; mini peaks and valleys.  No big niggles but there was some tightness in my left lumbar that I continue to tend to and a **stiff neck** flared up later in the week.

**First road ride** of the year and another day of **+700m elevation** on the XC bike to wrap up the week.

Temperatures were **below seasonal** though I was able to stay dry.

## SUNDAY FEB 13 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 80 minutes. Ideally on dirt, but the Lochside is perfectly ok too. 
Keep the effort easy.

Mobility 25 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Time: **81 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **13.4 km**

**Easy pace** but after [yesterday](ironman2022-29weeksout?sat), easy is all I had today.  80g lemonade with 10g of pectin (500ml water) and no GI issues, though I could taste some tartness from the pectin.

Mostly followed the [Colquitz River Trail](javascript:flkty.select(2);) for an out and back section, then a loop of _Cuthbert Homes Park_.  That route is ~90% packed gravel.  Weather was really nice too.

Sleep **5** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **5** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2500: 
4 rounds (50 easy free, 50 Fist drill, 50 gradual build from easy to strong. R :20 after each)
4x 100 Gradual descend 1-4 from easy to 1500 effort. R :30 after each. 
2 rounds (50, 100, 150, 200, 250 steady free w/ focus on a consistent turnover. R :30 after each rep) 
2x 50 easy to cool down and stretch out.   
Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2600m**

The swim felt like _"putting in the time"_ more so than _"this is fun"_, at least until the second round of the main set.  I pushed through to the end and was happy that I did; my mind was **focused** on the swim start to finish.

I drove to and from the pool to save time and had a **solid nap** after work too.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 10-12k. Generally an "easy to steady" effort for the first 3/4ths of the run. And the pace can pick up a bit over the final quarter of the run.

Rollers ~ 20 minutes. Short and easy spin.

### NOTES
Total Time: **84 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **10.9 km**

I saw that Victor Campenaerts just put out a mobility video and before heading out for the run, I did a number of his exercises.

This afternoon felt like a **real struggle** to match Yauki and Vince's pace for the outbound leg toward the _Hospital Hill_.  

There were a couple of times where they made a point to wait for me.  The last time they waited, they did so without knowing that the  sugar in my bottle was kicking in.

<!---->
The gap they gave me at 40 minutes, was my **tempo effort** for the week.  It took them about 9 minutes to make up the time I had put into them.
![Hospital Hill Run](/assets/jpg/run-20220215.jpeg)
They still wanted to go hard over the _Switch Bridge_ to end the run because it is a _"Strava Segment"_.  I indulged with a hard push up to the centre of the bridge and jogged the downhill portion.

Rollers, spinning comfortably for just over 20 minutes before dinner.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 Minutes** Ride: **29.7km @25.7kph**

Good sleep last night and a bit more of the Campenaerts mobility routine to start the day.

For reference, I rode the very same _Waterfront Clockwise_ route [55 weeks ago](https://mariostoc.co/traininglog/ironman2021-36weeksout?tue) with identical weather/same time of the day.  Today I was home **12 minutes sooner**.  Last year, I was pretty smoked near the end of a 3-week training streak.  Today, I was feeling stronger than expected on my first outside road ride, in forever.

Good effort in the pool this morning though there was a bit of lane congestion to deal with.  I rode my road bike to the pool and. even catching a three lights, I was minutes faster than on my XC bike.

I spent time on my massage chair working out knots in my back and neck; it has been a long time since I have done that and it was very much needed.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 35 minutes easy. Nice and easy.
 
Rollers ~ 20 minutes. Easy spinning.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Rinse, repeat; woke with a headache just like [last Friday](ironman2022-29weeksout?fri).  Neck is still stiff and might be a factor.  This sucks.  I broke down and 2 Advil in the morning so I'd have some comfort during the day.

After work, I headed out for the run; I felt heavy and went slow, really slow.  It was on to the rollers as soon as I got home.

Minimum <strike>effective</strike> dose.

### NOTES
Total Moving Time: **141 Minutes** &nbsp; Elevation: **727m**

Was awake to go for a swim at 0500; no desire to get up so I rolled over and went back to sleep.

The dilemma.  [Monday](/ironman2022-27weeksout?mon) is a holiday.  Do I swim today or push it to tomorrow and balance out the days between swims.  Tomorrow won because I'd then get access to the 50m pool in the morning.

The ride however was a go and I went off toward _Thetis Lake_ on my new mountain bike.  I have a loose gauge on fitness that I call _"Time to Dirt"_.  It is the start of the ride to the time I get to the gate at the end of _Westoby Road_.  Last summer, on my old XC bike, I'd make it to the gate in ~28 minutes.  So far, I have yet to crack 31 minutes on the new bike.

That is not the whole story as I have another time check on this route too; that being total time from the start of the ride to the end of the first single track run.  A good ride on the old XC bike had me to that second time check in ~40 minutes; on the new bike today, I was ~37 minutes to the end of _Comfy Wooden Chair_.

Today I rode _Electric Light_ to ride _Electric Ave_, west to east (first time). From there I took the fire road up and up to _Kalie's Connector_ but instead of popping out at _Munn Road_, I doubled back on _Frank's Trail_ (new to me).

This was a **fun ride** and I could feel the stimulus in my legs on the pedal home.
