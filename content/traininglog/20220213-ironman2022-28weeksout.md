Sleep **4** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 80 minutes. Ideally on dirt, but the Lochside is perfectly ok too. 
Keep the effort easy.

Mobility 25 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Time: **81 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **13.4 km**

**Easy pace** but after [yesterday](ironman2022-29weeksout?sat), easy is all I had today.  80g lemonade with 10g of pectin (500ml water) and no GI issues, though I could taste some tartness from the pectin.

Mostly followed the [Colquitz River Trail](javascript:flkty.select(2);) for an out and back section, then a loop of _Cuthbert Homes Park_.  That route is ~90% packed gravel.  Weather was really nice too.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2500: 
4 rounds (50 easy free, 50 Fist drill, 50 gradual build from easy to strong. R :20 after each)
4x 100 Gradual descend 1-4 from easy to 1500 effort. R :30 after each. 
2 rounds (50, 100, 150, 200, 250 steady free w/ focus on a consistent turnover. R :30 after each rep) 
2x 50 easy to cool down and stretch out.   
Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2600m**

The swim felt like _"putting in the time"_ more so than _"this is fun"_, at least until the second round of the main set.  I pushed through to the end and was happy that I did; my mind was **focused** on the swim start to finish.

I drove to and from the pool to save time and had a **solid nap** after work too.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 10-12k. Generally an "easy to steady" effort for the first 3/4ths of the run. And the pace can pick up a bit over the final quarter of the run.

Rollers ~ 20 minutes. Short and easy spin.

### NOTES
Total Time: **84 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **10.9 km**

I saw that Victor Campenaerts just put out a mobility video and before heading out for the run, I did a number of his exercises.

This afternoon felt like a **real struggle** to match Yauki and Vince's pace for the outbound leg toward the _Hospital Hill_.  

There were a couple of times where they made a point to wait for me.  The last time they waited, they did so without knowing that the  sugar in my bottle was kicking in.

<!---->
The gap they gave me at 40 minutes, was my **tempo effort** for the week.  It took them about 9 minutes to make up the time I had put into them.

They still wanted to go hard over the _Switch Bridge_ to end the run because it is a _"Strava Segment"_.  I indulged with a hard push up to the centre of the bridge and jogged the downhill portion.

 Rollers, spinning comfortably for just over 20 minutes before dinner.
