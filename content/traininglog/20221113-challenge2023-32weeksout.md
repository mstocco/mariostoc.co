# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, November 13, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**32** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Pay better attention to my body.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **6.5 Hours**

I feel like I was **MOSTLY PRODUCTIVE**

For a week that **started terribly**, it certainly **ended on a high**.

Quote of the week:
> The magic you are looking for is in the work that is avoided.

Despite it being cold, the sunshine this week helped with my overall mood and bouncing back from [Sunday's miss](javascript:flick('sun');).

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Outside Option: 
Bundle Up ~ 90 minutes. Easy riding on the MTB.

75 minutes on the trainer. 
25 minutes easy riding to warm up/start. 
6x 1:00 high cadence/stable hips....cadence won't be in the 140 range if you go for a minute...so find a cadence that is high, but somewhat maintainable with good form, 2:00 easy spinning after each rep. 
5 minutes easy riding between rounds. 
6x 1:00 high cadence/stable hips....cadence won't be in the 140 range if you go for a minute...so find a cadence that is high, but somewhat maintainable with good form, 2:00 easy spinning after each rep.

Yesterday's lifting a loaded trailer onto the hitch, then the run + swim was more than I could handle.

Sunshine and cold; I made the executive decision to **ride outside** after work.

Pedalled easy up to the north end of _Thetis Lake Park_ to see how comfortable I am on my favourite bit of single track (its been awhile).

Nothing close to a dab; rode the line I wanted.  
Rode home feeling confident.

Gorgeous twilight sky for the ride home.

### NOTES
Time: **115 Mins** &nbsp;Run: **9.5 km** &nbsp;Swim: **2300m**

Late morning start to the run.  I prepended _Cuthbert Holmes Park_ to my base route and did some of the muddy trails on _Panama Hill_.
<!----->
RPE for the run was **easy and comfortable** for the entire hour.  Although there have not been any (big) hills or strides of late, I am really enjoying the process that these 8 to 9ish km activities are delivering.  The roughly same route melts into the background and I get an hour to myself to chill out and be thankful.  

---

The 50m lanes where busier than [last week](challenge2023-33weeksout?sat).  Regardless, I was able to pick my spot and I got the work done.

I took a glance at a time for one of the later 100m reps and saw 2:01.  There wasn't a whole lot of juice left but I was able refocused on posture, the catch, rotation and finish and hit the wall with a 1:55 on the watch.

Better.
