### PLANNED WORKOUT
Outside Option: 
Bundle Up ~ 90 minutes. Easy riding on the MTB. 
Just getting out for a spin. Rolling or even hilly routes are good; keep things easy. 

Inside Option: 
75 minutes on the trainer. 
25 minutes easy riding to warm up/start. 
6x 1:00 high cadence/stable hips....cadence won't be in the 140 range if you go for a minute...so find a cadence that is high, but somewhat maintainable with good form, 2:00 easy spinning after each rep. 
5 minutes easy riding between rounds. 
6x 1:00 high cadence/stable hips....cadence won't be in the 140 range if you go for a minute...so find a cadence that is high, but somewhat maintainable with good form, 2:00 easy spinning after each rep.
9 minutes easy riding to finish up. 

### NOTES
<mark> Lower back is lit up </mark>

Yesterday's lifting a loaded trailer onto the hitch, then the run + swim was more than I could handle. Riding is not an option.
