# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 31, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**30 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
This week is a _"rinse, repeat"_ of [last week](ironman2021-31weeksout) with an small uptick in volume.  My goal is to handle that extra bit volume while paying attention to my overall energy level. 

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 90 minutes. Hilly route. On trails or dirt if possible. Does not have to be super hilly. A few rollers is good with me. Remember to bring some calories. 200 calories is about right.

2nd: Spin 60 minutes. Outside would be great, but a nice easy spin on the trainer is ok too.

### NOTES
Total Time: **150 minutes**

I could have slept a bit more as I was late getting to bed last night.

Motivation was low today and I procrastinated getting out the door.  I walked for a bit before hitting the start button on the watch.  I could have easily blamed today's rain for my low energy but my thoughts while walking were about my father and I was having a moment of missing him.  I took my time, breathed and when I was ready to get the workout started, that's when I started.

The run today did feel better than [last week](ironman2021-31weeksout?sun) but it still wasn't as _"springy"_ as [two weeks ago](ironman2021-32weeksout?sun).  Regardless, I was feeling good through the first 80 minutes but the last 10, the legs started to feel heavy and I was thankful to be on the final stretch home.

For calories, I mixed a 60g of lemonade into a 500ml bottle; this concentration was sweet and it was close to being too sweet for where I am at today.  That bottle was empty at 70 minutes.

I rode the trainer to close out the day.  Light spinning while I watched an old CBC Sports video of _2012 Subaru Ironman Canada_ (the last one on the Penticton course).  I'll probably watch that video again.
