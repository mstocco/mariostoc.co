# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, January 31, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**30 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
This week is a _"rinse, repeat"_ of [last week](ironman2021-31weeksout) with an small uptick in volume.  My goal is to handle that extra bit volume while paying attention to my overall energy level. 

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **EXPANDING MY ENVELOPE**

Before I knew it, this was a **+13 hour** training week and what I didn't do well was keep this training log up to date.

## SUNDAY JAN 31 üåß
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Run 90 minutes. Hilly route. On trails or dirt if possible. Does not have to be super hilly. A few rollers is good with me. Remember to bring some calories. 200 calories is about right.

2nd: Spin 60 minutes. Outside would be great, but a nice easy spin on the trainer is ok too.

### NOTES
Total Time: **150 minutes**

I could have slept a bit more as I was late getting to bed last night.

Motivation was low today and I procrastinated getting out the door.  I walked for a bit before hitting the start button on the watch.  I could have easily blamed today's rain for my low energy but my thoughts while walking were about my father and I was having a moment of missing him.  I took my time, breathed and when I was ready to start, that's when I started.
<!---->
The run today did feel better than [last week](ironman2021-31weeksout?sun) but it still wasn't as _"springy"_ as [two weeks ago](ironman2021-32weeksout?sun).  Regardless, I was feeling good through the first 80 minutes but the last 10, the legs started to feel heavy and I was thankful to be on the final stretch home.

225 calories from 60g of lemonade in a 500ml bottle; this was close to being too sweet for where I am at today.  That bottle was empty at 70 minutes.

I rode the trainer to close out the day.  Light spinning while I watched an old CBC Sports video of _2012 Subaru Ironman Canada-Penticton_.  I'll probably watch that video again.

Night sweats and a very groggy start to the morning; just like last week, I am stiff from the lumbar to my toes.  "Happy Monday!"

In the pool, things felt good.  2 things of note:

* During the main set, the difference between 2:19 and 2:26 for 125m is concentration.
* I noticed the difference a between 2200 and 2350 m workout.

I felt ok in the pool again today; 2 others and myself were generally swimming the same speeds but there was a slower guy that made for a bit of congestion; funny thing as he didn't seem to like being passed; as soon as I would pull up along side him, he'd find another gear and seem to race me to the wall.

After the swim, I left the facility with my run kit on and made my way toward town on the _Songhess Walkway_. This felt exactly like a run immediately after a swim workout; it was uncomfortable.  I attempted my best idea of what a stride might look like on the flat road near _Spinnaker's Pub_ but after the 2nd and every stride thereafter, I walked during the recovery period.  It was a slog back to the car too.

Weather was really nice and I had a lunch meeting for work so I jumped on the road bike and rode to _Royal Oak_.  This took about 18 minutes.

After lunch, I headed north on _Lochside Drive_ and crossed the highway at _Haliburton_ to ride _Old West Saanich_ and _Interurban_ home (the long way).

## SATURDAY FEB 06 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 3:00 on road or MTB. Steady riding. Staying well fueled. Staying well hydrated. Minimum of 800 calories on the ride.

Off the bike (within an hour or so) Run 30 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **243 minutes**

Road bike day only because I re-added the Shimano medium arch supports to my RP-9 shoes to see if that would help with their fit.  I have been on the fence for some time on shoes and although these shoes are _"close"_ in fit, there is something about them that I don't love about them.  The arch supports feel a bit _"aggressive"_ when just standing in the shoes but did disappear while pedalling.

Today was a mixed bag of weather and was mostly windy with a squall blowing in off the ocean to start.  I decided to pedal north and do a lap of the peninsula to see if I could stay out of the weather.  That idea paid of and heading into _Saanichton_, I enjoyed a decent tailwind.

I was out a bit longer than the scheduled 3 hours and that wasn't intensional.  I just miss judged the time.  

The ride didn't feel super fresh and I was on cruise control for the better part of the ride and enjoying the saddle time.  For calories, I replaced _"Jujubes"_ for _"Swedish Berries"_ to see if I liked them better.  They are sweeter but take more effort to chew and get down.  I measured 600 calories of candy and added 200 more in lemonade crystals to a water bottle.

I did take a relief stop at 3:13 into the ride and finished the last of the _Swedish Berries_ 15 minutes after that.  Throughout the ride, I thought about the run.  It was my legs driving the conversation in my head mostly.  Could I even do 30 minutes of running?  Do I 20 minutes and call it good?  Would Elliot mind if I replaced the run for a walk?  Rolling into the driveway, I still did not have a plan but the shoes, hi-vis vest and headlamp went on an out the door I went.

The run began sucking just as much as I thought it would; if I just carried on, the jelly legs would clear up in about 2 to 3 minutes.  7 minutes in and the legs are still not comfortable.  After 11 minutes, I finally noticed some spring off the bike path.  At 15:06, I turned around to follow my way back home.  If I could hold form, I might be able to even split the return to my starting point.  With 5 minutes to go, I really notice how hungry I am.  Back to the crack in the road where I started the clock, I am seconds faster on the return trip.  I wonder how much this will haunt me [tomorrow](ironman2021-29weeksout?sun)...
