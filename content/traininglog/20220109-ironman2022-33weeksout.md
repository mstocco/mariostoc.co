Frosty ride to the pool, wet on the way back.

Lanes were a bit more congested this morning but I was able to get the workout in.  Some reps had more rest, some had less as I timed myself against the others in the lane.  I **felt good** in the water, hungry on the last 150m rep and not much in the legs for the ride home.

Neck was stiff and lumbar on the tender side this morning.  I was tempted to ride the rollers a bit longer but stopped at 20 minutes and did some mobility work instead.

I was bothered by a twinge in my right ankle too but at 1545, I was kitted up for a run in the rain.

It was just Yauki and I for a loop of the _Songhess_ via the hill on _Lampson Road_.  I felt really good through to _Harbour Road_.  In typical Tuesday run fashion, the pace crept up the further we went and I felt myself starting to fade at the start of the bike path.  Over the _Selkirk Trestle_, Yauki really wanted to go so I matched his pace and found a groove to finish strong.

We walked the last bit as a cooldown.
