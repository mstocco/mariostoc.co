# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, March 14, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**24 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Status Quo:  Manage the stress from work and do things that will benefit my back.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **CLOSER TO "GO TIME"**

So many lessons delivered with this back spasm, injury, setback...

Coming out of this past month, I am a bit better at recognizing pressures from work and how to make better choices when reacting to them.  The injury introduced me to Michelle from The Athlete Centre and I am proprioceptively, a bit more in tune with my posture after working with her.

I really wish I didn't loose 4 weeks of of consistancy; I was in a nice training groove to kick off the first 6 weeks of 2021.

## SUNDAY MAR 14 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.  Run/Walk 60 minutes: 10 minutes walking to warm up/start/ 40 minutes easy/flat running. 10 minutes walking to finish up.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

I spent time with both TAC routines before heading out for the walk/run.  My QL is sore this morning but in good enough shape to put on socks and good enough shape for me to get out the door.  I walked to _Pearkes Arena_ before pressing start on the run.  I spent 90% of my time on the dirt trails of _Cuthbert Homes, Colquitz River and Swan Creek Parks_.   My back felt good; zero issues with the activity of running.  I did feel soreness in my left piriformis but for the most part, this was easily breathing, marathon pace for the prescribed 50 minutes.

### RUN THROUGH THE PARK(s)

I spent some massage time with the QL late in the afternoon; it is sore to the touch at its top (ribs).

## MONDAY MAR 15 üå§
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.  
5:30am: Swim 2100: 
2 rounds (6x 50 Steady swim w/ strong finish to stroke r :20. 2x 50 kick w/ tight kick. r :15) 
4 rounds (100 steady swim w/ tighter kick r :30, 50 steady/tight kick r :20)
4x 150 steady/aerobic w/ buoy and strong finish to stroke. r :45. 2x 50 super easy to cool down. 
Noon/Pm: Ride 30 minutes EASY on the trainer. Road bike (more upright than the TT) Keep this effort very easy. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2100m**

I was awake a couple times in anticipation of an early 5am start; not the best sleep.

Once there, the fast lane had the least congestion but as more people arrived, that lane became busy and I felt pressure to put out more effort than was appropriate for me.
<!---->
Recognizing that, I did my 2nd round of kick work over in the slow lane before slotting into some space in the continuous lane.  Overall, this felt like a good workout and again, I was able to comfortably swim the **last 100m** in **1:49**.

---

I rode my mountain bike to and from the pool this morning (30 minutes of moving time).  I swung through downtown before riding home and I was able to catch the [sunrise](javascript:flkty.select(2);); nice start to the work week.

---

My back is a bit better again this morning.  The lumbar is just tight; not sore or pinchy.  The top of my QL is still tender but less so than yesterday. Today's swimming and riding did not aggrevate it further.

## TUESDAY MAR 16 üå§
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **5** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine. 
Run/Walk 60 minutes: 10 minutes walking to warm up. 45 minutes easy running. Fairly flat route. 5 minutes walk to finish up. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **53 minutes**

Somewhat of an okay sleep despite the switch to Daylight Savings Time.  My lumbar is tight and the tender spot high on my QL is a lot less sore today.  I did not expect this to have cost me a month of training and that is super frustrating.

Perfect evening for a pre-supper jog around _Swan Lake_.  Unfortunately, both soleus' were pretty lit up so I stuck to the dirt for the better part of the first 30 minutes.  Ironically, I really didn't feel good until I was back on asphalt and heading towards home.  Apart from nice weather and a spectacular sunset, physically this wasn't a the most fun 43 minutes (I got back early).
<!---->
I felt heavy (I am heavy) and the piriformis on the right is aggravated now too.

Outside of the activity, I hit an important milestone with a project at work.  Hopefully this will turn the wick down on the overall stress to a level more conducive for getting back to January's training volume.

## WEDNESDAY MAR 17 üå§
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine. 
Ride 75 minutes on MTB. Flat to rolling terrain. Easy effort. Getting outside. 
Walk 30 minutes. Nice short walk to get outside and on your feet.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes**

Decent sleep last night and I am looking forward to riding today (last sunny day in the forecast).  I knocked out another productive day at work too.

Wanted to ride my road bike but MTB it was.  I pushed with a bit more effort to keep up with a roadie on his commute back to _Colwood_.    It was fun to ride with someone if only for a short bit.  At the _E&N Junction_, I headed back to town.  I rode easy for the remainder of the hour before stopping at Carina's office.  From there, she and I pedalled home.  I felt like I could have ridden _Bellamy Trail_ (XC loop).

## THURSDAY MAR 18
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.  
Run/Walk 60 minutes: 10 minutes walk to start. 50 minutes easy running. Flat terrain works. If you're feeling great, <strike>you can hit a local hill or two. Aka: You don't have to avoid all the hills</strike>.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Good sleep and unless someone told my I have been dealing with a sore back, I would not have known this morning.  Things are looking up.

Work however, threw a curveball at my afternoon.  I was about to head out the door for today's scheduled jog when I answered a _"bing!"_ from my computer.  That was a call that pushed passed 1800 and into dinner.  After dinner, I was back on the keyboard and today's training was a miss.

## FRIDAY MAR 19
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 minutes**

Probably the best day I've had in a month.  It started with work and a project that I had been worked on at work has come to an end.  That is a weight off my shoulders.
<!---->
To celebrate, I did yesterday's 50 minute jog mostly on the dirt paths of _Cuthbert Homes Park_.  With the reflection of a storefront window, I did catch a glimpse of my posture at the 49th minute and I did see a hinge in my hips.  I had a stretch as soon as I returned home to confirm that my quads and hip flexors were tight.  This was a good catch.

In the pool, I had a decent workout too.  Officially recorded 2050m because I over-swam the second 400.  I recorded (again) with the GoPro and I am still shorting my stoke at the end of the workout.  The last 100m was still in the ballpark (1:46 after some rest).

## SATURDAY MAR 20 üå¶
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.   
Ride 90 minutes on the Goose or Lochside. Read: **FLAT**. Keep the effort easy. Just going for a spin. Road or MTB.   
Walk 60 minutes. Flat to rolling terrain. Ok for a hill or two, but don't go to Gowlland Tod! üôÇ 
Might be nice to do your routine, then go for the walk.

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **34 km**

It was shorter walk this morning before breakfast (30 minutes). 

For the ride, the route that I picked was a little less than FLAT in some places and I spent a little longer in the saddle (10 minutes).  I was on the mountain bike but if I wanted to be hip and modern, I'd call today a "gravel" ride (so mountain biking without a mountain).
<!---->
Basically, this was the _Centennial Trail_ paralleling _West Saanich Road_, then _Old West Saanich_ to _Elk Lake_ then home.  The route kept me out of the wind for the most part.  I felt good for the most part; my back was ok and I was thankful to have MTB gearing for the hill on _Old West Saanich_.
