## SUNDAY MAR 14
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.  Run/Walk 60 minutes: 10 minutes walking to warm up/start/ 40 minutes easy/flat running. 10 minutes walking to finish up.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

I spent time with both TAC routines before heading out for the walk/run.  My QL is sore this morning but in good enough shape to put on socks and good enough shape for me to get out the door.  I walked to _Pearkes Arena_ before pressing start on the run.  I spent 90% of my time on the dirt trails of _Cuthbert Homes, Colquitz River and Swan Creek Parks_.   My back felt good; zero issues with the activity of running.  I did feel soreness in my left piriformis but for the most part, this was easily breathing, marathon pace for the prescribed 50 minutes.

### RUN THROUGH THE PARK(s)

I spent some massage time with the QL late in the afternoon; it is sore to the touch at its top (ribs).

### PLANNED WORKOUT

Noon/Pm: Ride 30 minutes EASY on the trainer. Road bike (more upright than the TT) Keep this effort very easy. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 minutes**

I was awake a couple times in anticipation of an early 5am start; not the best sleep.

I rode my MTB to the pool.  Once there, it looked like the fast lane had the least congestion but as people continued to arrive, that lane became busy and I felt pressure to put out more effort than was appropriate for me.
<!---->
Recognizing that, I did my kick work over in the slow lane before slotting into some space in the continuous lane.  Overall, this felt like a good workout and again, I was able to comfortably swim the last 100m at 1:49.

I swung through downtown before riding home and I was able to catch the [sunrise](javascript:flkty.select(2);); nice start to the work week.

My back is a bit better again this morning.  The lumbar is just tight; not sore or pinchy.  The top of my QL is still tender but swimming and the ride did not aggrevate it further.
