## SUNDAY APR 04 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run/Walk 80 minutes: Walk 10 minutes to loosen up. Run 65 minutes. Easy effort. Flat to rolling terrain. 5 minute walk to finish up.

### NOTES
Run Time: **66 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **11.6 km**

A nice socially distanced, outdoor Easter brunch at the in-laws.  From there, I hitched a ride to _Sayward Road_ which gave me enough distance to run the rest of the way home.

I walked 15 minutes before the run and not much after I pressed "stop" on the watch.

This route was mostly flat to false-flat; an overall net downhill route with some dirt sections (perfect for an easy effort).  I averaged **5:45/km pace** and this was like other recent runs, comfortably aerobic and very focused on maintaining a stable pelvis over the +hour.

Pretty sure that it was Melanie McQuaid that flew past me on _Lochside Drive_. Cool!

## MONDAY APR 05 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **5** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.  
Ride 45 minutes. Easy. Inside on the trainer or outside on any bike you like. Spinning out after a weekend of solid volume. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **48 minutes**

After work, I spent some time on the bathroom renovation and rode the TT bike on the rollers after dinner.

Light pressure on the pedals and I watched the 1997 Kona race (PNF v Badmann) on YouTube .  Most of the time I was up on the bullhorns and maybe ~10 minutes on the aerobars.

Almost a shame that I didn't get to ride outside but so far this April, it has been far colder than normal.  This worked.

## TUESDAY APR 06 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.   
Ride 60 minutes. Any bike you like. Flat to rolling terrain (or inside) EASY effort.   
Run/Walk 30 minutes: 30 minutes flat and easy running. Optional walk to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **82 minutes**

Another busy day at work.

I took the road bikie for a spin on the Goose to Colwood and then rode the shoulder until the intersection of Goldstream Avenue and Vetran's Memorial Parkway.  That put me at 30 minutes and with a net downhill on the way back; I needed to find a bit more road to ride.  The solution was to re-visit the Crystal View Hill, going up to Ruby Court.  I **felt good** going up that hill too (it was only one trip to the top).  On this ride, I didn't have to stop once.

### SIMPLY TIME IN THE SADDLE

Getting off the bike, I didn't waste much time before heading out for the run; enough to get into some running kit and put my bike away.

**This run sucked.**  My legs didn't just feel heavy, they felt like concrete.  It took a long 13 minutes to shake the effects of the bike, and even after that, the legs had no juice tonight.  Ironically, after 8 minutes, I was averaging **5:35/km** on a flat section of the _Goose_ but if you would have asked me, I would have honestly guessed closer to 7:00/km.

After 22 minutes, I pulled the plug on this horrible torture session.

## WEDNESDAY APR 07 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.  
5:30am: Swim 2200: 
4 rounds (50 Easy free, 50 as 25 fist drill/25 strong finish to stroke, 50 steady/tight kick w/ board r :20)
4 rounds (3x 50 steady swim w/ lots of rotation and a tight kick. r :20. 100 Strong effort, finishing each stroke well. r :40) 
5x 100 steady free w/ buoy. r :20. 2x 50 EASY to cool down.   
Bike commute: 10 minutes easy to the pool. 30 minutes, long way home. Easy back as well. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **123 minutes** &nbsp; Total Swim: **2800m**

I was awake early enough but with the right amount of procrastination, I was late getting to the pool.

I started the workout in the _Slow Lane_ as that had the least amount of people in it; that was my second mistake of the morning.
<!---->
The lane congestion was as bad as I'd ever seen it at _Crystal Pool_.  I finally got out and walked over to the _Continous Lane_ and swam the rest of my time there.  In total, I completed 1600m but before staring the _5x100m w/ buoy_ set, my allotted time had run out.

The forecast had called for rain early this moring but it was dry before I left home and was still dry when I left the pool.  I took a 35 minute route through Esquimalt to make my way home.  My **legs felt heavy**, likely from [yesterday](javascript:flick('tue');).

After work, it just so happened that I had a second, afternoon lane paid for at Esquimalt Rec.  I was back in the water to get that 5x100m set complete and I did a little more (1200m).  After a casual warm up, I did the 5x100m and **felt really good** (maybe the shorter pool).  I followed that with 300m of easy effort swimming and it was then that I started to feel the day catching up with me.  After a bit of rest, I finished with a steady 100m and came in at **1:43.1**;  no joke, this was unexpected.

Solid day, time for bed.

## THURSDAY APR 08 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.   
Run/Walk 80 minutes: 5 minutes easy walking to warm up. Run 70 minutes. Flat route. Bring a gel! Maybe some water as well. 5 minutes walking to cool down. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **11 km**

The first few minutes of the day were groggy, and any idea of doing the run before breakfast was tossed.  A 15 minute nap at 1600 helped.

The run was simply time on feet effort.  I probably did a better job with the breathing/posture on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) than I did tonight though.  My pace was more down to earth too; 6:07/km over the 10km of bike path and dirt.  I stopped after 63 minutes to say hi to an old hockey buddy, Mike M. in the parking lot of _Pearkes Arena_.
<!---->
### FIRST 63 OF 70 MINUTES
![Run Map](/assets/jpg/runmap-20210408.jpeg)
I walked for 15 minutes before the run and I did jogged the last kilometre home after my catch-up with Mike.

About 100 calories of Maynards candy in lieu of a gel was consumed and my soleus (left and right) were mildly stiff tonight.

Although it was a sunny evening, a stiff south-west wind felt way colder than it should for April in Victoria.  A quick glance at the forecast for next week gives me some hope that normal, seasonal temperatures will be here soon.

## FRIDAY APR 09 üåß
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.   
5:30pm: Swim 2100: 
4x 100 as 25 easy/25 strong finish to stroke. r :30. 
4x 100 w/ buoy as 25 over rotation/25 strong finish to stroke. r :30. 
6 rounds (50 steady kick r :20, 50 Strong swim w/ strong finish to stroke and lots of rotation from hips r :30)
2x 25 EASY. 
600 continuous/steady. Trying to find a nice comfortable rhythm. 
2x 25 easy to cool down.

Bike commute: 30 minutes easy to the pool. 30 minutes, long way home. Easy back as well. 
Yes, it's a broken hour ride. If you'd rather do 10/50 or 50/10, that is ok with me. Whatever works best with your schedule.

### NOTES
Total Time: **53 minutes**

I am feeling a bit stiff this morning.  Riding the rollers before breakfast did not happen.
<!---->
In fact, I had another late afternoon nap (after a long day at work and before swimming).

The warmup sets were a warm up that I needed.  My arms felt tired, like my legs did [yesterday](javascript:flick('thu');).  The feeling didn't last I soon I was into the workout.  My watch quit counting lengths after 1375m; I noticed this part way into the 600m effort.  Math in my head is never a strong point but I found myself figuring that I am averaging 1:50/100m so, round that up to 2:00 minutes, multiply by 6 and I should be done shortly before 12 minutes.  The last wall was touched at 11:39.

I did short myself 50m on an early warm-up so that I could "cool down" with a 100m and I touched that wall in 1:43. &larr;<sub>PR effort last year.</sup>

I am feeling (less effort) and seeing (times are better) improvements in the pool.  That is until I bring my GoPro to the pool and watch after the fact.  It looks to me that I am hinged at the hip and I need to dedicate time to the mobility work (TAC Routine 2).
