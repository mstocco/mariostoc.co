A nice socially distanced, outdoor Easter brunch at the in-laws.  From there, I hitched a ride to _Sayward Road_ which gave me enough distance to run the rest of the way home.  This is a flat to false-flat and overall net downhill route with some dirt sections too; perfect for an easy effort.  I averaged **5:41/km pace** and this was again, comfortable.  I did get passed by Melanie McQuaid on _Lochside Drive_; she was cruising at a pretty good clip too.
