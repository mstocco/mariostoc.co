### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash; 

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

An intense Pacific cold front crossed Vancouver Island today. Strong westerly winds developed in the wake of the front this afternoon, especially near Juan De Fuca Strait.  At least is wasn't raining while I was out on the scheduled run.  I started the day helping family in Duncan.  I thought about doing the run up there but decided that I'd rather just make my way south.

I had a nap once I got home and when I woke, the wind was still blowing but the rain had stopped.  Perfect.
