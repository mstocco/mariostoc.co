### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.   
Travel to/From Duncan. Moving furniture.   
50 minutes: 15 minutes of walking to warmup. Give yourself the time to loosen up and get into a walking rhythm. Run 30 minutes, Flat route, EASY effort. Walk 5 minutes to cool down/relax

### NOTES
Run Time: **33 minutes** &nbsp; Average Pace: **5:41/km**

I started the day helping family with an early morning trip to Duncan.  I thought about doing the run up there (for nostalgia I guess) but decided that after moving boxes and furniture, I'd rather just make my way south.  I needed food and thought it best to do my TAC Routine before the activity and after sitting in the driver's seat.
<!---->
I had a nap once I got home and when I woke, the wind was still blowing but the rain had stopped.  Perfect.

While out on walk, the sun was shining and I made my way upwind.  Once it was time to press go on the jog, a huge squall appeared on the horizon; I was in a race to get the 30 minutes in.  By luck, that squall missed me on my route and when I reached the 30 minute mark, I was feeling good to run another hill _(Lurline)_ and go a bit longer.  

Before I got too far past that hill, a biblical hail fell; message to not go beyond Elliot's 30 minutes received.

### SHORT BUT PRODUCTIVE SUNDAY RUN

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Total Time: **104 minutes** &nbsp; Swim Total: **2100m** 

Maybe it was the nap yesterday afternoon but I was up and restless from about midnight until about 2am.  

After a very crisp ride to the pool; there was a heavy frost last night but the roads dry and safe.
<!---->
At the pool, I was able to put together, what I felt was a **solid workout** (for me).  The second to last 200m (with the pull buoy) was starting to drag but the last 200m effort felt on point.  The final 100m _"cool down"_ was clocked with a smooth **1:46.7**

I did notice that my left (non-dominant) arm splashes on entry the more tired I get.  If I focus, I can correct it with better hand placement and better timing of the start of the pull.

There was an absolutely [beautiful sunrise](javascript:flkty.select(2);) on the extended ride home from the pool.

## TUESDAY MAR 30 ‚òÄÔ∏è

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.   
Ride 60 minutes. Any bike you like. Flat to rolling terrain (or inside) EASY effort.  
Run/Walk 35 minutes: 5 minutes walking to get loose, 30 minutes flat and easy running. Optional walk to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

A bit of a headache this morning; might have needed a bit more dinner last night.

Sunshine and a 60 minute ride, it was the road bike this afternoon.  I rode an out and back route, _The Goose_ to _Highland Road_, then up to its end at _Herbate Road_.  My **legs felt strong** this afternoon; according to Strava, I PR'd a bunch of segments too.  It wasn't all roses; the extra kick up and over some of the punchy parts had my lumbar a bit _"cramped"_.

Once home, and before I put my shoes on, I took the time to do the TAC routine with some extra focus on the hip flexors. 

On the run, I picked a my simple, down to the _Selkirk Trestle_ and back route.  I focused on breath-work for the majority of the run.  I would not say the breath-work is completely _"natural"_ yet, but I am starting to get a feel things.  For example, holding the bit of tension in the pelvis and letting the thoracic relax is becoming familiar.  Getting lost in the activity may have meant that I wasn't running as easy as I should.  My average pace for this short run was **5:37/km** and I was slow up and over the _Switch Bridge_ on the way home. &nbsp; &mdash; Overall, solid day.

Another clear and frosty morning for the ride to the pool.  Once there, I think I found the culprit(s) that bought out all of the 5:30am swim slots for April and I wasn't impressed.  This was about 6 adults doing a group workout in the fast lane.
<!---->
In between their sets, they would congregate on the wall and enjoy small talk, leaving zero space for anyone else.  Then when that group eventually decided what their next set will be, they'd all send off with next to little spacing between.  At one point, I saw them coming back, kicking 3 abreast; how would someone not in that group get by?

I should only focus on what I can control but that selfishness on display bothered me today.

With that group monopolizing the fast lane, everyone else was squeezed into other 2 lanes.  I counted 9 swimmers in the continuous lane and 5 in the slow lane; I did my workout in the slow lane and did my best with spacing.

I did not get into a flow like the swim on [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');).  I ran short on time and skipped the last 2x50m; I was definitely getting tired.  My last 100m was clocked at **1:55.1**.  For contrast, my best 100m (mid-workout, after a 50m kick) was **1:45.7**.

Some of the slower times posted earlier in the workout were because of lane congestion.

### LAST SWIM BEFORE EASTER

 For the ride home, I pedalled up Doncaster Drive; cresting the eastern aspect of that hill meant an opportunity to soak in another breathtaking sunrise.  Whatever frustration I felt in the pool was erased with that moment of sunshine.

## THURSDAY APR 01 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run/Walk 75 minutes: 10 minutes walk to loosen up. Run 60 minutes. EASY effort. Flat route. Walk 5 minutes to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **10.6 km**

Refreshed is the word to describe how I felt to start the day.

This afternoon's run was a bit of a mixed bag.  After a 15 minute walk, I eased into the activity that took me to _E&N Bike Path_, along the _Songhess Waterfront_ and then the _Goose_ home.  Once on the bike path, I found a rhythm with breathing and pace and simply went with it.  For the first 7 kms, running was effortless and my focus on posture was on point, so much so that I realized that I'd be home sooner than the scheduled 60 minutes.  I took a detour through an industrial park adjacent to the _Goose_.  It was there that I started to fade a bit.  Around 9 km, I noticed that I was starting to chafe.  At 10 km, I was in the home stretch and finished strong but my old running shorts are definitely being retired.

I wore my Nike Zoomfly 3 trainers for the first time since the 5K block of training last winter.  They are noticeably louder than the Altra Escalente 2.
