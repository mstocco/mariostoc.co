### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

An intense Pacific cold front crossed Vancouver Island today. Strong westerly winds developed in the wake of the front this afternoon, especially near Juan De Fuca Strait; it blew pretty good here in town too.  At least is wasn't raining while I was out on the scheduled run.  I started the day helping family in Duncan.  I thought about doing the run up there but decided that I'd rather just make my way south.

I had a nap once I got home and when I woke, the wind was still blowing but the rain had stopped.  Perfect.
