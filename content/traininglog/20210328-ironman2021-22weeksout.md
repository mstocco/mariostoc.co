### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.   
Travel to/From Duncan. Moving furniture.   
50 minutes: 15 minutes of walking to warmup. Give yourself the time to loosen up and get into a walking rhythm. Run 30 minutes, Flat route, EASY effort. Walk 5 minutes to cool down/relax

### NOTES
Run Time: **33 minutes** &nbsp; Average Pace: **5:41/km**

I started the day helping family with an early morning trip to Duncan.  I thought about doing the run up there (for nostalgia I guess) but decided that after moving boxes and furniture, I'd rather just make my way south.  I needed food and thought it best to do my TAC Routine before the activity and after sitting in the driver's seat.
<!---->
I had a nap once I got home and when I woke, the wind was still blowing but the rain had stopped.  Perfect.

While out on walk, the sun was shining and I made my way upwind.  Once it was time to press go on the jog, a huge squall appeared on the horizon; I was in a race to get the 30 minutes in.  By luck, that squall missed me on my route and when I reached the 30 minute mark, I was feeling good to run another hill _(Lurline)_ and go a bit longer.  

Before I got too far past that hill, a biblical hail fell; message to not go beyond Elliot's 30 minutes received.

### SHORT BUT PRODUCTIVE SUNDAY RUN

### NOTES
Total Time: **104 minutes** &nbsp; Swim Total: **2100m** 

Maybe it was the nap yesterday afternoon but I was up and restless from about midnight until about 2am.  

After a very crisp ride to the pool; there was a heavy frost last night but the roads dry and safe.
<!---->
At the pool, I was able to put together, what I felt was a **solid workout** (for me).  The second to last 200m (with the pull buoy) was starting to drag but the last 200m effort felt on point.  The final 100m _"cool down"_ was clocked with a smooth **1:46.7**

I did notice that my left (non-dominant) arm splashes on entry the more tired I get.  If I focus, I can correct it with better hand placement and better timing of the start of the pull.
