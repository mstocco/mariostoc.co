Pretty common theme, _Colquiz River Trail_ to the _Centennial Trail_, then over to the grounds of _Camosun College_.  The run started slow and stayed slow and easy for the almost 2 hours.  I missed some math in my head and stayed out a bit longer than was written.  Not that big of a deal in the grand scheme as I was running comfortably slow and had lots of sugar in my bottle today.

Finally some nice late March weather to enjoy!

Make sure you have plenty of water and a few calories on the ride as well. Want to be well fueled for the rest of your day!
