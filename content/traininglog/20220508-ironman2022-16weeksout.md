Similar terrain to Victoria 70.3
Race-day fueling and hydration.

Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **114 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **18.5 km**

Pretty common theme, _Colquiz River Trail_ to _Centennial Trail_, then over to the grounds of _Camosun College_.  The run started slow and stayed **slow and easy** for the almost 2 hours.

I stayed out a bit longer than was written because I couldn't do math converting 1:45 into minutes.  Not that big of a deal in the grand scheme as I was running comfortably slow and had lots of sugar in my bottle today.

Finally some nice late March weather to enjoy!

4 rounds (50 swim, 50 as 25 fist/25 focus on finish to stroke, 50 w/ 4x sighting. R :20 after each)

Really good sleep but I am feeling stiff this morning; left lumbar in particular, still being my biggest niggle.

Swim was later in the afternoon.  The hardest part was counting to 20 (half the distance equals double the lengths).

<mark>Total Time: **0 Minutes**</mark>

### MORNING NOTES
If I didn't have it yet, I am pretty sure I have it now.  **Head is pounding** and I am a bit nasally congested.

It is every I can do to control my emotions.  

### LATE AFTERNOON UPDATE
Headache cleared after 600mg of Advil at 0330, 400mg at 0800 and some patience.

I felt well enough to work out, but I chose to organize my workshop, clean my TT Bike, pull my wetsuit out of storage and went for a walk to the grocery store (~25 minutes).

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Easy spin to the pool.  
Swim 2900: 
300 easy swimming to warm up. 200 w/ buoy and focus on rotation. 4x 50 w/ 4x sighting r :20. 
3 rounds (6x 100 @ 1500 effort/focus. R :20 after each. 2x 50 EASY. R :45 after each)
100 extra easy to cool down.
 
Ride 75 minutes home. Certainly this is a bit longer of a ride after a swim. And the swim isn't exactly easy. 
Make sure you have plenty of water and a few calories on the ride as well. Want to be well fueled for the rest of your day!

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2900m**

Solid sleep last night.  I was up in time to swim before work but chose to see just how I am feeling.  25m lane in the afternoon it would be.  I did have a whole lane to myself too.

<div style="height:27px;"></div>
Not much to note from the swim except that my 100m time/effort after a long rest (first of the set of 6) was quick/easy.

---

The weather was cold and grey and although I did ride to and from the pool, I pedalled in the garage (TT Bike/trainer) for the bulk of my allotted time.  Effort was easy.

## THURSDAY MAY 12 üåß
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:30 on TT bike. 
Ride 15-20 minutes easy to a hill of your choice (you had a few west of you that worked well in the past) 
6x 3 minutes uphill @ 30-45 minute TT effort. Basically....good solid climbing, but 100% ok to continue climbing when you hit the top each time. Even after #6!
Easy spin down after each as your recovery. You can take a few seconds at the top as well if you like. 
Easy spinning to cool down.

OFF THE BIKE: 
Run 30 minutes. Flatter route. Easy effort. Bring calories. Always best to be prepared. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **112 Minutes** &nbsp;Ride: **Indoor**

Another good sleep but another crappy afternoon weather wise.

Who knew one can suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder in the middle of May?  Off and on showers and a cold wind from the south; the wind chill was 4¬∞C according to The Weather Channel.

I picked an indoor workout from earlier this spring, put the 2020 IRONMAN Copenhagen race on the screen and did my best to simulate what I was supposed to do on a real hill.  Bulk of the time and all the efforts on the aerobars.

I had a bottle with 90g of maltodextrin/sugar mix beside me on the bike and I finished 3/4 of it.

The run felt just ok.  I may have felt better if it was warmer out.  A cold south wind was blowing and I honestly could have worn a pair of gloves this evening.  I was in a trisuit and a cycling jacket and it was still cold.

I was immediately into my Escalantes and out the door wearing a trisuit and a cycling jacket for the run.  I honestly could have worn a pair of gloves too.  I cut the run a bit short because the rain was starting again.

Morning check in and the sorest part of my body is my right ankle.  My lumbar is less stiff and I am at a greater range of motion before I feel stiffness there.
