# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, May 8, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**16** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Monitor for COVID symtoms and train accordingly

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **12.5 Hours** <small>down 3.5 from last week</small>

I feel like I was **APPROPRIATELY CAUTIOUS**

Apart from skipping the hour scheduled on [Tuesday](javascript:flick('tue');), I got through this week unscathed and hit on every other workout.

The weather is still cold for this time of year though Saturday afternoon eventually turned pleasant.

No COVID symptoms.

## SUNDAY MAY 8 üå§
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 1:45. Easy effort. 
Similar terrain to Victoria 70.3
Race-day fueling and hydration.

Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **114 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **18.5 km**

Pretty common theme, _Colquiz River Trail_ to _Centennial Trail_, then over to the grounds of _Camosun College_.  The run started slow and stayed **slow and easy** for the almost 2 hours.

I stayed out a bit longer than was written because I couldn't do math converting 1:45 into minutes.  Not that big of a deal in the grand scheme as I was running comfortably slow and had lots of sugar in my bottle today.

Finally some nice late March weather to enjoy!

Really good sleep but I am feeling stiff this morning; left lumbar in particular, still being my biggest niggle.

Swim was later in the afternoon.  The hardest part was counting to 20 (half the distance equals double the lengths).

<mark>Total Time: **0 Minutes**</mark>

### MORNING NOTES
If I didn't have it yet, I am pretty sure I have it now.  **Head is pounding** and I am a bit nasally congested.

It is every I can do to control my emotions.  

### LATE AFTERNOON UPDATE
Headache cleared after 600mg of Advil at 0330, 400mg at 0800 and some patience.

I felt well enough to work out, but I chose to organize my workshop, clean my TT Bike, pull my wetsuit out of storage and went for a walk to the grocery store (~25 minutes).

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Easy spin to the pool.  
Swim 2900: 
300 easy swimming to warm up. 200 w/ buoy and focus on rotation. 4x 50 w/ 4x sighting r :20. 
3 rounds (6x 100 @ 1500 effort/focus. R :20 after each. 2x 50 EASY. R :45 after each)
100 extra easy to cool down.
 
Ride 75 minutes home. Certainly this is a bit longer of a ride after a swim. And the swim isn't exactly easy. 
Make sure you have plenty of water and a few calories on the ride as well. Want to be well fueled for the rest of your day!

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2900m**

Solid sleep last night.  I was up in time to swim before work but chose to see just how I am feeling.  25m lane in the afternoon it would be.  I did have a whole lane to myself too.
<!---->
<div style="height:27px;"></div>
Not much to note from the swim except that my 100m time/effort after a long rest (first of the set of 6) was quick/easy.

---

The weather was cold and grey and although I did ride to and from the pool, I pedalled in the garage (TT Bike/trainer) for the bulk of my allotted time.  Effort was easy.

## THURSDAY MAY 12 üåß
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:30 on TT bike. 
Ride 15-20 minutes easy to a hill of your choice (you had a few west of you that worked well in the past) 
6x 3 minutes uphill @ 30-45 minute TT effort. Basically....good solid climbing, but 100% ok to continue climbing when you hit the top each time. Even after #6!
Easy spin down after each as your recovery. You can take a few seconds at the top as well if you like. 
Easy spinning to cool down.

OFF THE BIKE: 
Run 30 minutes. Flatter route. Easy effort. Bring calories. Always best to be prepared. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **112 Minutes** &nbsp;Ride: **Indoor**

Another good sleep but another crappy afternoon weather wise.  Off and on showers and a **cold wind** from the south; a wind chill of 4¬∞C according to _The Weather Channel_.
<!---->
<div style="height:27px;"></div>
Who knew one can suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder in the middle of May?  

I picked an indoor workout from earlier this spring, put the 2020 IRONMAN Copenhagen race on the screen and did my best to simulate what I was supposed to do on a real hill.  Bulk of the time and all the efforts on the aero bars.

I had a bottle with 90g of maltodextrin/sugar mix beside me on the bike and I finished 3/4 of it.

I was immediately into my Escalantes and out the door wearing a trisuit and a cycling jacket for the run.  I honestly could have worn a pair of gloves too.  Despite the cold, the run felt just ok; I cut it a couple minutes short because the rain was starting to fall again.

## FRIDAY MAY 13 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2800: 
3 rounds (100 easy swim, 2x 50 Shark-fin r :20 after each)
10x 200 aerobic/smooth w/ buoy. Focused on relaxed and controlled breathing and good rotation. R :30 after each.
4x 50 EASY to cool down.

Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **53 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2800m**

Morning check in and the sorest part of my body is my right ankle.  My lumbar is less stiff and I am at a greater range of motion before I feel stiffness there.

At the pool, I got to work and things were productive but during the last half of the main set, I hit pause on the watch to empty my bladder; this is a first and probably the product of swimming in the afternoon.
<!---->
<div style="height:27px;"></div>
I also had friends at the pool that mean another pause just before the cooldown.  I could have called it at 2600m but I swam the cooldown anyway.

I noticed my quads on the commute home; weird as I was using a pull buoy the majority of the time.

## SATURDAY MAY 14 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 3:30-3:45 on TT bike. 
Get in the climbs...but a very similar route to the race course. 
Generally an easy to steady effort with a bit more pressure on the climbs...and a 30-50 minute section that's in the bars and "efficient"   
* Fueling often. Hydrating the whole ride.

Off the bike: Run 30 minutes EASY. Flat route. Very easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **203 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **88 km**

I started from home instead of driving to _Elk Lake_ first but today was better than 90% of the Vic 70.3 bike course.  

Efficient was the name of the game for the trip north; lots of time in the aerobars.  With a cool, northerly breeze (10 kph), my speed hovered around the 30 kph mark, heart rate in the 120's.

<!---->
<div style="height:27px;"></div>
Although I feel like I've ridden this route a hundred times, today I paid more attention to the route for the best opportunities to grab calories; putting my head into the event at the end of the month.

I rode past my usual pit-stop area on _Tatlow Road_ near the halfway point of the course but couldn't make it past my rest stop at the top of _Willis Point Road_.

Mental note that it takes me about 15 minutes from the left turn back on to _West Saanich Road_ to the top of the last hill on _Oldfield Road_; the hardest part of course in my opinion.


### RIDE COMPARISON

While not an the exact route, this ride from 11 months ago shows some interesting similarities:

* Average RPM: 85 (identical)
* Average BPM: 120 (identical)
* Avg Respiration Rate: 26 brpm (nearly identical)
<!---->
<div style="height:27px;"></div>
I was slower overall today with an average moving speed of 25.8 kph versus 26.6 kph last year.

### CALORIES
My aero bottle filled to ~400ml with 120g maltodextrin, 120g lemonade, 100g of sugar, 3 pinches of salt.  Roughly 1200 calories and it was thick.  I had to heat it up to get it to dissolve.  I had 1.5 litres of plain water in 2 bottles for chasing the sludge.

This was consumed at a fairly consistent rate over the ride (bottles empty on the home stretch along _Interurban Road_) and apart from the syrupy texture being pretty gross, I had zero GI today.

---

The run off the bike was done with little delay apart from locking my bike in the garage.  I was able to find a **comfortable rhythm** at 5:20/km pace right from the beginning.  On my usual flat, 30 minute out and back route to the _Selkirk Trestle_, that put me well beyond (1:15) my typical turn around point.  I followed up the return trip to log a perfect even split.
