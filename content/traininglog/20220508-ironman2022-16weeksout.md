### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 1:45. Easy effort. 
Similar terrain to Victoria 70.3
Race-day fueling and hydration.

Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **114 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **18.5 km**

Pretty common theme, _Colquiz River Trail_ to _Centennial Trail_, then over to the grounds of _Camosun College_.  The run started slow and stayed **slow and easy** for the almost 2 hours.

I stayed out a bit longer than was written because I couldn't do math converting 1:45 into minutes.  Not that big of a deal in the grand scheme as I was running comfortably slow and had lots of sugar in my bottle today.

Finally some nice late March weather to enjoy!

Really good sleep but I am feeling stiff this morning; left lumbar in particular, still being my biggest niggle.

Swim was later in the afternoon.  The hardest part was counting to 20 (half the distance equals double the lengths).

### MORNING NOTES
If I didn't have it yet, I am pretty sure I have it now.  Head is **pounding** and I am doing my best to control my emotions.  

After all the cold weather this spring, this is the second nice spring day in a row.  Now this.

### AFTERNOON NOTES
Later on in the afternoon, the headache cleared.  600mg of Advil at 0330 and 400mg at 0800 plus some patience.  Could I have rode 30, jogged 30?  Yes.  Did I?  No.

I took the time to clean up my workshop, clean my TT Bike, pull my wetsuit out of storage and went for a walk to the grocery store (~25 minutes)

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Easy spin to the pool.  
Swim 2900: 
300 easy swimming to warm up. 200 w/ buoy and focus on rotation. 4x 50 w/ 4x sighting r :20. 
3 rounds (6x 100 @ 1500 effort/focus. R :20 after each. 2x 50 EASY. R :45 after each)
100 extra easy to cool down.
 
Ride 75 minutes home. Certainly this is a bit longer of a ride after a swim. And the swim isn't exactly easy. 
Make sure you have plenty of water and a few calories on the ride as well. Want to be well fueled for the rest of your day!

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Solid sleep last night.  I was up in time to swim before work but chose to see just how I am feeling.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:30 on TT bike. 
Ride 15-20 minutes easy to a hill of your choice (you had a few west of you that worked well in the past) 
6x 3 minutes uphill @ 30-45 minute TT effort. Basically....good solid climbing, but 100% ok to continue climbing when you hit the top each time. Even after #6!
Easy spin down after each as your recovery. You can take a few seconds at the top as well if you like. 
Easy spinning to cool down.

OFF THE BIKE: 
Run 30 minutes. Flatter route. Easy effort. Bring calories. Always best to be prepared.
