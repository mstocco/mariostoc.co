Up early and drove to the pool this morning.  The workout was altered slightly as the kick board would not line up with four 50m lengths per set.  The realignment gave me a 10x100m set and I had fun with that, even pushing myself to make it a descending effort for the back half.

Lumbar was on the tighter side this morning.  Regardless, I was on the rollers before coffee.

Walk 30 minutes. Nice and short.

Rollers 60 minutes: 20 minutes easy spinning. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes of moderately strong riding.....something you could hold for 30-45 minutes. aka: You should never be trying too hard! 3 minutes easy spinning between each. 13 minutes easy spinning to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Ride Time: **60 Minutes**

No morning walk; I had a glorious sleep-in instead.

After a decent day at work, I hopped on the rollers.  I think I did my best with the strong efforts; certainly they were felt more in my legs than in my lungs and I did step it up a bit on the last minute of the 5th effort.

After dinner, I grabbed the shovel and moved 3" of wet snow off the driveway and sidewalks (~40 minutes).

### NOTES
<mark> Total Time: **0 Minutes** </mark>

Huge dump of wet snow last night _after_ I had cleared the snow before bed.  By the time I was done digging out, I would have already been coming back home to start my work day.

Best part of today was talking to my coach; formal SBR training was a miss.

Whenever: Run 30 minutes easy. Get out the door and on your feet.

### NOTES
Total Time: **77 Minutes** 

Needed the 4x4 to get out of the subdivision this morning.  Once in the water, I had another **productive workout** doing the swim scheduled [yesterday](javascript:flick('wed');).  The 8x100m set in particular was descending from 1:57 to 1:48 in near one second increments.  That was a **great start** to the day.

After work, I **jogged easy** on the _Goose_ as it was the only consistently clear path.
