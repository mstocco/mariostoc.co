# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, January 2, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**34** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Build off of [last week](ironman2022-35weeksout) while starting the first work week of 2022.

## SUMMARY
Total SBR Time: **7.5 Hours**   
<sup><strong>&check;</strong> Up 2 hours from [last week](ironman2022-35weeksout).</sup>

I feel like I was **ADAPTIVE** <small>re: weather/work</small>

First week back at work and it didn't encroach on training that much.  [Snow](javascript:flkty.select(2);) was more of a factor to my training schedule this week.  With the key workouts that I did get in, I think I was able to find the right amount of intensity appropriate for the first week of January.

Lumbar was stiff for the most part but never precarious.  My overall **energy was good** this week too.

![5:20am and instead of going to the pool, I found myself clearing more snow.](/assets/jpg/IMG_3952-977x550.jpeg DIGGING OUT)

Up early and drove to the pool this morning.  The workout was altered slightly as the kick board would not line up with four 50m lengths per set.  The realignment gave me a 10x100m set and I had fun with that, even pushing myself to make it a descending effort for the back half.

Lumbar was on the tighter side this morning.  Regardless, I was on the rollers before coffee.

With a weather window closing, Yauki and I decided to run at noon.  Out and back on the _Goose_ with a **strong finish** to the run. ![Run Pace Chart](/assets/jpg/run-20220104.jpeg)

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Walk 30 minutes. Nice and short.

Rollers 60 minutes: 20 minutes easy spinning. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes of moderately strong riding.....something you could hold for 30-45 minutes. aka: You should never be trying too hard! 3 minutes easy spinning between each. 13 minutes easy spinning to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Ride Time: **60 Minutes**

No morning walk but a glorious sleep-in.

After a decent day at work, I hopped on the rollers.  I think I did my best with the strong efforts; certainly they were felt more in my legs than in my lungs and I did step it up a bit on the last minute of the 5th effort.

After dinner, I shovelled 3" of wet snow off the driveway and sidewalks (~40 minutes).

### NOTES
<mark> Total Time: **0 Minutes** </mark>

Huge dump of wet snow last night _after_ I had cleared the snow before bed.  By the time I was done digging out, I would have already been coming back home to start my work day.

Best part of today was talking to my coach; formal SBR training was a miss.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Ride: Lower back exercises/Breathing.  
Rollers ~ 20 minutes. Just enough to say you pedaled. 

Whenever: Run 30 minutes easy. Get out the door and on your feet.

### NOTES
Total Time: **77 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **1900m**

To do [yesterday's scheduled swim](javascript:flick('thu');), I needed the 4x4 to get to the pool this morning.  The 8x100m set was completed with descending times, from 1:57 to 1:48, in near one second increments.

The swim was a great start to the day and like [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');), I felt like this was **productive** workout.

---

After work, I **jogged easy** on the _Goose_ as it was the only consistent path clear of slush and ice.

---

Before bed, I found and worked on a hot spot (tender) on my left soleus, lateral side near the top of the fibula.  Typically when I have tenderness in either soleus, it is medial below the calf.  My guess is there was some extra tension while on some of the slippery sections of the today's run.

Not the best sleep as I woke with a stiff neck.  Lumber is tight too.

Ischium (both of them) are sore after 80 minutes on the rollers; otherwise a good workout.
