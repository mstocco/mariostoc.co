Up early and drove to the pool this morning.  The workout was altered slightly as the kick board would not line up with four 50m lengths per set.  The realignment gave me a 10x100m set and I had fun with that, even pushing myself to make it a descending effort for the back half.

Lumbar is on the tighter side this morning.  Regardless, I was on the rollers before coffee.
