# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, May 30, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**13 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
If I can duplicate how I felt [last week](ironman2021-14weeksout) again this week, that would be <span class="agencyvc" style="color:black;">GOLDEN</span>.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **FINDING THE EDGE**.

This ended up being a **14 hour week** despite missing a day of training on [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');).  All three bikes were ridden and this was my biggest swim week to date (**~7500m**).  [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) was my first open water swim of the year.

The renovation still takes a bit of time and energy but that project is starting to come to an end.

I had a right ankle flare up that cleared itself by the end of the week.

I woke up with some tightness in my right ankle and that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  It lingered through the day too.

That right ankle was not a bother during the run.  I my legs felt like I had a solid ride [yesterday](ironman2021-14weeksout?sat)  and I just went with that.  Super chill effort, focusing on posture and breathing while taking in the scenery of _Downtown_, _James Bay_ and then the western bit of _Dallas Road_.

Just before I reached my turn around, I noticed a runner heading in the opposite direction as me.  Super good form and going a decent clip.
<!---->
It was a fantastic day to sip lemonade and jog easy along the Victoria shoreline.

Around _Fisherman's Wharf_, I hopped off the sidewalk and ran on the side of the street.  My legs were feeling a bit heavier but I pretended like I was running the last mile of the marathon.  No sooner than I was in my make believe world, running for an elusive sub-4 hour time, that runner with the good form pulls even with me (but on the opposite sidewalk).

#### It's on brah!
5:45/km became 5:20/km and that other runner was still there.  Going past the Legislature, 5:20/km became 5:10/km, that other was slotted in behind me, 10m back and still there.

_Government Street_ turns into _Wharf Street_ and the other runner, still on my tail.

Finally on the other side of the _Johnson Street Bridge_, I turn towards the _Goose_ and my new buddy turned back towards _Downtown_.  So a bit more than 3km of impromptu tempo work on the back half of today's long run.
<!---->
So the questions is, "was this smart to do?"   I certainly felt good with the raised pace; it was comfortable and in the moment, I felt like I had a lot more in the tank.  It felt worse to slow down to the plodding pace for the last few kilometres.  Maybe a better question to ask is, "if that other runner followed me to _Uptown_, would I have continued pushing above the prescribed pace?"

#### To Mile Zero and Back

### NOTES

I slept well but my right ankle is tight again this morning.  Time to hit it with some compression.

Life happened once again, this time it was our drywaller arriving very late to complete his final touches in the bathroom.  We have a tile contractor scheduled for tomorrow and it didn't feel responsible to go for a ride with renovation work still needing to be completed.

Tonight's mountain bike ride was a missed workout.

### NOTES
Total Time: **130 minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2400m**

I am marking the sleep as a 3 but only because I napped (**slept soundly**) from 1600 to 1800 this afternoon.  Without that nap, I would have graded sleep as poor; it was restless until 0050 then up at 0455 for the swim.
<!---->
My right ankle is still bothered and sore again today.  I feel that ankle during the swim too.  Specifically what is bothered is the **fibularis tertius muscle**.  That has its own cascading effect, namely with the soft tissue running behind the tibia/fibula, fibularis brevis (lateral) and flexor digitorum longus (medial).  I have to remind myself that I have been here before with this tiny muscle and it will calm down.

Lanes were congested until the end session.  I was in the continuous lane with at times 9 or 10 others.  Apart from a female triathlete in a yellow HPR swim cap (our paces matched), I was passing people during the fist drill lengths.  I did my best to make it work.

I rode my XC bike to and from the pool this morning and again this evening; **easy effort** only on the bike, keeping movement, limiting torque in the ankle.  I had an errand (get Castelli's tri-suit to the Fed-Ex drop off) so I killed 2 birds with one stone by replacing tonight's 30 minute easy run with a ride.  I noticed the bit of added resistance of the XC bike compared to the road bikes I have put time on recently.

Morning points: I woke up feeling refreshed which may have something to do with the afternoon sleep I had [yesterday](javascript:flick('tue');).  More importantly, my right ankle is less stiff than this time yesterday.

### NOTES

Up and out the door early for the swim.  I think 8:15 for the bike to the pool is a PR as I was a bit lucky with the traffic lights this morning.

My ankle was a touch bothered by the kick reps but in good shape for the remainder of the swim.  I whiffed on the workout by continuing the 2 Rounds of the main set and making it 3.  I caught it, stopped recording the main workout and started recording a basic swim to pick up the long steady 750.  I made it an 800 + 50m cool down length and without trying, recorded a new PR.  For the 750m distance, I shaved 30 seconds off my previous best, recorded just before Covid 19 hit last year.

Before leaving the pool for the hour ride I had a banana; it sat well (no GI) but the effort was easy.  Or at least it was until I decided to hold off a dude on his e-bike during the last stretch of bike path between _Helmcken_ and home 

Great way to start the day.

My ankle is feeling better and I had a late afternoon nap to cap it off too!
