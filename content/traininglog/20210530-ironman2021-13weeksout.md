I woke up with some tightness in my right ankle and that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  It lingered through the day too.

That right ankle was not a bother during the run.  I my legs felt like I had a solid ride [yesterday](ironman2021-14weeksout?sat)  and I just went with that.  Super chill effort, focusing on posture and breathing while taking in the trip into _Downtown_, _James Bay_ and then a western bit of _Dallas Road_.

Just before I hit the turn around, I noticed a runner heading in the opposite direction as me.  Super good form and going a decent clip.

Around _Fisherman's Wharf_, I hopped off the sidewalk and ran on the side of the street.  My legs were feeling a bit heavier but I pretended like I was running the last mile of the marathon.  No sooner than I was in my make believe world, running for that sub-4 time, that runner with the good form pulls even with me (but on the opposite sidewalk).

It's on brah!

5:45/km became 5:20/km and that other runner was still there.  Going past the Legislature, 5:20/km became 5:10/km, that other was slotted in behind me, 10m back and still there.

_Government Street_ turns into _Wharf Street_ and the other runner, still on my tail.

Finally on the other side of the _Johnson Street Bridge_, I turn towards the _Goose_ and my buddy turned back towards _Downtown_.  So maybe a bit more than 3km of impromptu tempo work on the back half of today's long run.

So the questions is, "was this smart to do?"   I certainly felt good with the raised pace; it was comfortable and in the moment, I felt like I had a lot more in the tank.  It felt worse to slow down to the plodding pace for the last few kilometres.  Maybe a better question to ask is, "if that other runner followed me to _Uptown_, would I have continued pushing above the prescribed pace?"
