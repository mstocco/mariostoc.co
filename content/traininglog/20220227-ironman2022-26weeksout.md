# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, February 27, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**26** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Training is my escape from the news üá∫üá¶ 

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **11 Hours**

I feel like I was **ADDING ANOTHER LAYER**

Despite missing [Thursday](javascript:flick('thus');), this was a another **really good week**.

Biggest ride of the year so far, a 1000m PR in the pool and most importantly, a general feeling that I am getting fitter.

Company's coming.  Spent a good part of the day tidying up the house and once it was done, headed out for the run.  To bad because it was sunny in the morning and starting to rain while out on the trail.  Today called for dirt so I stuck primarily on the Colquitz River Trail.  I **felt heavy** (because I am heavy these days).

On the positive, there was a lot of Z2 time.

Right ankle and TN joint was sore before bed.

One glass of wine with dinner last night an I feel hung over this morning.  I drove to the pool.  In the water, I faired no better than my head was feeling and the swim, especially before the 5x200m set, was a slog.  I had thoughts of calling it early but stuck with it and completed the workout.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 30 minutes EASY.

Run 65-75 minutes w/ your friends. Easy effort as long/far as they will allow. Final quarter to a third of the run will be a bit quicker. Still all good with me.   _Maybe bring a gel/similar on this run to stay well fueled‚Äã_

### NOTES
Total Time: **103 Minutes**  &nbsp; Run: **12.5 km** <small>(hilly)</small>

Finally a spring like day.  Yauki, Vince and I set off for our regular Tuesday afternoon run.  We started slow on a route that eventually included _Craigflower_, _Admirals_ and _Lampson_ hills.  Steady effort across the entire route and finished feeling strong.

I cooled down on the rollers after I got home.

A bit of a sore throat; should I worry?

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2300m**

Pedalled my MTB to and from the pool this morning; 8¬∫C and drizzle.  It is nice that it is daylight for the leg home.

In the pool, I had tired lats and triceps to start, and on cue, after 300m, I was into the workout.  Robert Johnson was at the pool this morning.  He made a turn at the wall while I was resting after finishing my 3x50 set; I wasn't thinking about the next 50m being EASY, I pushed off to see where I was with a really good swimmer 5m ahead of me.   All things considered, I am doing okay.

That mental lapse did put me off schedule for the written workout, turning 3x50 + 50 + 2x50 into 6x50; that was felt on the final lengths.  Overall, a **good swim** this morning.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Today was a miss.  I thought I'd get a weather window for an afternoon ride and the showers rolled through.  It did clear up closer to dinner time and by that time, I was thinking about riding the rollers.  I did get a good amount of our plum tree pruned before dinner but after dinner, I was tired and went to bed.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
_Optional spin to/from the pool_.

Apart from recording the activity in 2 parts, the swim was done accordingly.  I noticed my _left lumbar_ being tight during the kickboard lengths.  There was lane congestion during the 1000m but I picked my way through the lanes.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 3:00 on MTB ~ Goose or Great trail. 
Lots of steady riding. Never all that hard, but always pedaling. 
Stay well fueled. Stay well hydrated.

### NOTES
Moving Time: **184 Minutes** &nbsp; Total Ascent: **954m**

_The Great Trail_ from the _Old Island Highway Interchange_ to the top of the _Golden Heights_ and back.  Solid workout.  This route can not be ridden with _"never all that hard"_ as a workout attribute.  _Wolf Hill_ looked to be 800m averaging 17% on the hardest part.  There was a haymaker of a hill on the way back that I almost broke a tooth while gritting my way over its crest.


Great sleep last night but my left lumbar/glute is still tight and a bit sore.
