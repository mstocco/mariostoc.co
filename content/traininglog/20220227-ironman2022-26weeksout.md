### NOTES
Total Time: **95 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **15 km** <small>@6:18/km</small>

Company's coming.  Spent a good part of the day tidying up the house and once it was done, headed out for the run.  To bad because it was sunny in the morning and starting to rain while out on the trail.  Today called for dirt so I stuck primarily on the Colquitz River Trail.  I **felt heavy** (because I am heavy these days).

On the positive, there was a lot of Z2 time.

Right ankle and TN joint was sore before bed.

One glass of wine with dinner last night an I feel hung over this morning.  I drove to the pool.  In the water, I faired no better than my head was feeling and the swim, especially before the 5x200m set, was a slog.  I had thoughts of calling it early but stuck with it and completed the workout.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 30 minutes EASY.

Run 65-75 minutes w/ your friends. Easy effort as long/far as they will allow. Final quarter to a third of the run will be a bit quicker. Still all good with me.   _Maybe bring a gel/similar on this run to stay well fueledâ€‹_
