The pool was open but the swim was a miss.

My back feels better today but I did sleep in and missed my window to get to the pool.  In its place, I walked for 90 minutes to to the top of [Christmas Hill](javacript:flkty.select(2);) with Carina.

After dinner, I did an hour long, Bodyweight Warrior mobility session.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Option A: Rollers ~ 45 minutes easy. 
Option B: MTB ~ 60 minutes easy. 

Run 55-65 minutes easy w/ your buddies

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 Minutes**

Snow shovelled.  Cleared the 4" that fell overnight.

I did a short mobility routine before heading out on the run; the idea being to clear any stiffness that might have set in from the shovelling in the morning.

The roads, sidewalks, bike path and trail around _Swan Lake_ was covered in different degrees of packed snow and ice.  Traction was solved by some well placed sheet metal screws into an old pair of trainers.  I did feel a bit worked as the softer snow had the same effect as running in soft sand.  This run put me over **1200 km** for the year.

I rode the rollers in the basement suite and had a bit of the run coverage from _Kona 2014_ on the TV.  Effort was easy.

This was the best day of training in a _long time_; it felt good to get it done before dinner.
