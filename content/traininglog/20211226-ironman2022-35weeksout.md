The pool was open but the swim was a miss.

My back feels better today but I did sleep in and missed my window to get to the pool.  In its place, I walked for 90 minutes to to the top of [Christmas Hill](javacript:flkty.select(2);) with Carina.

After dinner, I did an hour long, Bodyweight Warrior mobility session.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 45 minutes easy.   
Run 55-65 minutes easy w/ your buddies

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 Minutes**

Snow shovelled.  Cleared the 4" that fell overnight.

I did a short mobility routine before the run; the idea being to clear any stiffness that might have set in from this morning's shovelling.

The roads, sidewalks, bike path and trail around _Swan Lake_ were covered with different degrees of packed snow and ice.  Traction was solved by some well placed sheet metal screws into an old pair of trainers.  I did feel a bit worked as the softer snow had the effect as running in soft sand.  This run put me over **1200 km** for the year.
<!---->
I rode the rollers in the basement suite and had a bit of the run coverage from _Kona 2014_ on the TV.  Effort was easy.

This was **the best day of training in a long time**; it felt good to get it done before dinner.

### NOTES
Run Time: **31 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **1650m**

More shovelling this morning and the snow was heavier too.

Made it to _Crystal Pool_ for the swim workout; Carina came with me too.  This felt like a regular workout except the lifeguards pulled the ropes for the 50m lanes before I could finish the 6x150 set so I stopped the activity on my watch, reconfigured it for 25m and effectively did a cool down for what I thought was the balance.
<!---->
I did the ~30 minute run even though this was changed to a walk (read the updated email late).  Everything felt good; easy pace just in the neighbourhood on the hard packed, unplowed roads.
