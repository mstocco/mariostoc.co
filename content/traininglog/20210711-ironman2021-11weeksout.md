Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Open Water swim: 
3x 3 minutes easy swimming to warm up. r 1:00. 
3x 10 minutes @ 1/2 IM effort/focus. What is that?? An effort you can hold for around a 2k. Doing the swim is part of figuring it out. r 2:00 after each. 2-3 minute splash around to cool down. 
2nd: Run 90 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort. Stay well fueled.

### NOTES
Total Time: **140 minutes**

Mid-afternoon swim at _Elk Lake_ went off without a hitch.  There was a bit of a chop on the water but nothing that could cause a problem.   I just settled into a nice rhythm that I felt I could have held for 40 minutes.  No wetsuit to assist today.

The run was pretty straight forward; Hamsterly Beach to home roughly following the Colquitz Creek on mostly dirt trails.  I felt better than my pace suggested but that may have been because of the net downhill off the route.  I may have been slow because of the heat too.  Regardless, my goal was 90 minutes with good form and I th

## TUESDAY JUL 13
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 75 minutes. Short spin to Mill Hill. (I might have the name wrong) 6x 3 minutes uphill, 1st Rep @ steady climbing to warm up, #2-#6 @ an effort you cold hold for 30 minutes all out, 2-3 minutes easy spin down hill to recover. Short spin home. 
Off the bike: Run 40 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

After work, I jumped on the road bike back to _Crystal View Estates_, the subdivision on the south side of _Mill Hill_.  I got the work in, 6 times up but I probably went a bit harder on the last one than what was called for in the workout.  It was an out of the saddle for the majority of the climb up to the school and just enough effort not to completely blow up for the balance of the trip to the top.

Off the bike, I set out to do 40 minutes but I had a odd pain in my left shin.  I walked to first 400m and then took some time to stretch out my calves, quads and hip flexors.  Continuing on, I ran the balance of my time (30 minutes) flat and easy to and from the _Selkirk Trestle_.  No issues with the shin and I found a nice easy rhythm on the way back home.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I really wanted to sleep longer this morning.  I had a Red Bull before heading out the door and if it wasn't for the traffic light on Blanchard and Hillside, I would have set a new PR for a solid effort to the pool.

11°C this morning was chilly on the bike for the first 3 minutes and then the cool air felt good; thinking about a Penticton morning at the end of September.

Today's pool workout was harder than usual.  The 8x100m strong efforts had me pushing through a higher heartrate.  Fun and engaging is how I would describe that set.  For where I am at today, 100m is not an all out distance so I did have an element of "learn the appropriate pace"; I think I did ok with it.

Work is busy today so I headed home; easy effort except for punching up one small hill that when I crested it, I had to remind myself to save something for [Sunday](ironman2021-10weeksout?sun)!
