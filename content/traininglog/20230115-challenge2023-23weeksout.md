Feeling a bit smoked.  Quads on the ride to the pool, lats once in the water and my right side serratus posterior inferior is tight in this morning.

I felt like I was fighting the water; Sunday lanes were congested too.
<!----->
Regardless, I did my best to stay on schedule.

The afternoon run was completed as easy effort along the _Panama Flats_ route.

### NOTES

If ever I needed a light spin day, it was today; maybe it was [yesterday](javascript:flick('sun');)...

Typical Monday at work and if I could, I would have ridden outside.  Instead I just spun easy on the trainer.  Next time I have a ride like this, I will probably dig out the rollers just for variety.

Quads still on the fatigued side and my right serratus is still tender.

Everything else is feeling pretty good.

Right serratus is tender but let's carry on...

Maybe one of my **more focused swims** and I was **feeling good**, at least while in the water.

Started to tail off during the last 150m reps; felt like I could go forever during the 500m rep.

I could feel my back got some work while putting on my shoes to hit the treadmill.  Carry on...

I got on the _AirRunner_ and although the effort was **easy**, I still had to work at not falling off the contraption.  Heart-rate chart below:

Woke up feeling a bit less stiff but my right serratus is still not back to normal. 

Curious how the trainer measured my asymmetry this afternoon.  Left/Right was better during the efforts but were out of whack during the recoveries (~6% favouring the left).

### NOTES

Work had me on an emergency call from 2130 to well past midnight last night.  üò°

My back is still a bit stiff but not as intense and less local to the serratus this morning.
<!----->
In the water, I had a guy, maybe a bit younger than me but looking way too fit for January, share a 25m lane with me.  He swam continuous while I stuck to the timed intervals.  It worked out as we were mostly able to stay in phase with each other even though I was stopping for breaks.

After the pool, I really noticed that my back was tight.  Same, right side, serratus and maybe even the lat too.

## FRIDAY JAN 20 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-run: Dead bugs, breathing, and Glute Bridges.
Run 50 minutes.....
30 minutes easy running. 
5x :30 strides, 1:30 easy jogging after each. 
10 minutes easy running to finish up

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **0 km**

The hint of a sore throat [yesterday](javascript:flick('thu');) is no longer a maybe.  Nasal congestion along with a sore throat this morning confirms I am dealing with a bug of some sort.  My back is continues to be on the stiff side too.
