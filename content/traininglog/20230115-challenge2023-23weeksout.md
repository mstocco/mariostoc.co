Feeling a bit smoked.  Quads on the ride to the pool, lats once in the water and my right side serratus posterior inferior is tight in general this morning.  I felt like I was fighting the water.  Regardless, I did what I could to stay on schedule; lane was congested for periods too.

The afternoon run was completed as easy effort along the _Panama Flats_ route.
