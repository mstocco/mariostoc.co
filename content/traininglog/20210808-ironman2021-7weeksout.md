# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, August 8, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**7 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I'll be missing my Wednesday night ride this week, replacing it with a run.  My goal is to get the training in and wrap up 2 big tasks at work too.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was **LAGGING A BIT**

With a scheduled day off on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');), I didn't accumulate anywhere near the same Sun/Sat volume as last week (**9.875 hours**).  This was a nicely balanced week of training regardless.

It's just as well because our first (but short lived) bout of forest fire smoke came and went on days without bigger volume.

No niggles apart from chronically sore hamstrings.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 2:00. Flat to rolling route on the TT bike.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **56 km**

Quick dash up to the airport and it was quick; I had a pretty decent tailwind pushing me up the peninsula.  I took _West Saanich Road_ to _Interburan_ for the leg home.  Despite the wind, it was a nice evening for a ride and I felt as good as I ever have riding the hillier route south.

Two bottles of lemonade were with me on the bike.  One with 100g of mix (up from 90g).  I got through the first bottle in the first hour but got less down on the second for no other reason than I wasn't paying attention.  I was in a groove, especially coming down _Interurban Road_.

There was a weird (acute) pain in the tendon running behind the lateral side of my left ankle (fibularis brevis) that needs to be written down.  This was occasionally felt when standing on the pedals.

If it wasn't a PR, it was close to it for the sprint to the pool this morning.  I caught the light at _Finlayson_ and _Douglas_ which is usually the deal breaker for a good time for the +3km commute to the pool.

Lots of 50m efforts with some lane congestion.  I had one of those strong efforts done without focus and I touched the wall at over 50 seconds.
<!---->
The next one was with redemption at 44 seconds.  The time to the wall was starting to fade on the 11th strong effort.

Before the 12th rep, another swimmer, Duncan, asked me how my training was going  We talked for a bit (he is doing IMC Penticton for the 4th time).  With that bit of rest, I did the 12th strong 50m length in 42.9 seconds.  I was out of time to get the cool down in.

For the long commute home, I pedalled out to _King George Terrace_ and followed the waterfront back home.  Temperature was 13¬∞C and I was comfortable wearing summer kit.

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT

Ride 80 minutes. Short spin to local hill. 
6x 3 minutes uphill, 1st Rep @ steady climbing to warm up, #2-#6 @ an effort you cold hold for 30 minutes all out, 2-3 minutes easy spin down hill to recover. Short spin home.

### NOTES

Carina and I both woke with sore throats this morning.  I didn't have the best sleep either.

This was a staple ride, out to the _Crystalview Subdivision_ for 6 trips up to the top.  I picked the road bike for no other reason than I'd rather put the wear and tear of the hills on the bike that is less important to me.
<!---->
I felt ok pedalling easy to Langford before doubling back to the hill.  I rode this like I thought it was written, getting my heart rate into the low 140s (30 minute effort); a bit less on the first trip up and a bit more of a push on the sixth.

Once home, I settled into the evening and didn't have much energy for an after sunset run.  I stretched and went to bed.

## WEDNESDAY AUG 11 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **5** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 90 minutes. HILLY route. Generally an easy effort. But you have the all clear to push a little bit on the uphills.

Great day to stretch!

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes** &nbsp; Elevation: **250m**

Long day on the keyboard but I was able to push away (finally) at 1830.

I bought new running socks online and they arrived today.  _Swiftwick Aspire_ (1 inch cut)  and I think I really like them.

For the run, I headed up and over _Craigflower_ the hills of _View Royal_.   I felt ok; no niggles to start but my high hamstrings had moments feeling tender.  More so on the way back.
<!---->
I packed ~700ml of water in my running vest and 27 pieces of Maynards Peach Fuzz; 3 pieces every 10 minutes (timed with my watch).  I am thinking this was ~200 calories per hour.

It was warm out and I feel like I ran appropriately for the temperature.  With the Maynards on a schedule, I didn't feel like I was getting near the _"90 minute fade"_.  Just the opposite, I felt good at the end.

#### Other Notes
No sore throat this morning.

100 super easy to cool down. 

Long commute home...Ride 60 minutes EASY. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **130 minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2800m**

I can try to nail every workout but sometimes that doesn't happen.  This morning's swim was an example of not getting things done perfectly.

It started with enjoying 2 very ripe, very sweet peaches from the neighbor's tree before leaving the house this morning.
<!---->
The sugar woke up the bowel and I was very _"crampy"_ half way through the warm up set.

Focus on the 250m reps was **not my best**.  Besides the cramps, my mind drifted to work and thoughts of my dad.  I've had better mornings in the pool.  I also didn't get the final 250m + 50m round in.  That was poor preparation from last night.  I could do better.

On the ride to the pool, I was "big ringing it" and was sub-8 minutes to the pool; which is always fun.

I was going to ride home and figure out a ride for later in the afternoon but with it now being daylight leaving the pool, a [smoky haze](javascript:flkty.select(2);) was pushing into the area from the east.

We have been very lucky with forest fire smoke this summer.  I did the long commute home because who knows how smoky it will be by the end of the day.

<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **40 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **6.2 km**

I had a restful sleep though I can feel some fatigue in my quads as I go up and down the stairs.

Garmin's latest update to my watch now suggests run workouts.  Ironically, it suggested a 30 minute "recovery run" so I pressed start just to see what this new programming does.  I ran very easy to the _Selkirk Trestle_, looked at my watch and saw minutes.  In my mind, I was early to my typical turn around spot so I kept going.

I think the watch was telling me that I had 13 minutes left...

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Off S/B/R.  Walk out to Beechy Head (East Sooke Park)

### NOTES
Nice day for a walk along the _Coast Trail_ to _Beechy Head_; one of my father's favourite fishing spots.

Along the way, there are petroglyphs carved into the rock.
