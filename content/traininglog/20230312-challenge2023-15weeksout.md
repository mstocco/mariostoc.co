# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, March 12, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**15** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
&mdash;

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **11.3 Hours**

I feel like I was **PLAYING CATCH UP**

Missed [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) even my effort to journal was on the back foot to start the week.

A couple of snappy runs plus one on tired legs, focused efforts in the pool and a new trail explored on the mountain bike highlighted this week.

The weather is turning more spring-like but still on the cool side.

No training but I did write an RSVP website for the wedding.

Indoor ride after work.  I put the trainer on free-ride, put a full length movie on from Netflix and just pedalled.  Mixed in some standing and changed the resistance slightly from time to time.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Time: **135 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **2950m** &nbsp;Run: **11.7 km**

Pretty good swim although I didn't get to the pool quick enough to get it all done in LCM; 2000m in the long format.  The break in between the lane change was ~4 minutes and I swam an extra easy 50m before restarting the workout for the remaining 900m.

I drove to the pool and ran outside in the sunshine.  Summit Park is close and I did 3 trips up the steep section of Summit Ave, 3 trips up The Rise and 3 trips the length of Topaz.  I missed hitting start on the watch; this was ~700m longer than recorded on Garmin.  I **felt ready good** and had a runner's high through to bedtime.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash;  

### NOTES
Moving Time: **105 Mins**  &nbsp; Accent: **550m**

I think I may have read this wrong and just went up to the top of Stewart Mountain on my MTB.  I stopped part way up to take off my jacket/glasses/etc and had enough of a rest that I cleared a rocky section that had me pushing the bike up every other time.

From the top, I took Tom's Trail for the first time off the hill.  Trail Forks has it listed as black, the new CRD signage has it as blue.  Regardless, I explored this route carefully; not the time of the year to fall on that terrain.   

This was a fun ride.  I considered taking the TT bike off the trainer but the air is still too cold when an MTB ride is an option.

### NOTES
Time: **105 Mins** &nbsp; Swim: **2100m** &nbsp; Run: **10.4 km**

A better sleep last night but the knot in my trap is still aggravated.

Got the workout done just before the ropes were moved from 50m to 25m.  I found a groove on the 12th of 16 lengths (800m rep); I wish I could have held on to that groove longer.

I ran south of the pool this afternoon with the goals of getting in some hills, keeping it easy and drawing a GPS track that never intersects.  Got all three goals checked off and I **felt really good** in doing so.

12x 50 w/ buoy. Tight core/aerobic/smooth. R :10 after each. Still setting up good form, but with the buoy to help. 
2x 100 super easy to cool down/stretch out. 

### NOTES
Time: **103 Mins** &nbsp;Run: **8 km** &nbsp;Swim: **2500m**

I felt good in the water this afternoon.  50m lane format so the rhythm of the 12x sets wasn't broken up by a wall.  I plugged the workout into the Garmin incorrectly but did swim the workout as written.

The jog home on the other hand was a real chore.  All except for a couple minutes was heavy legs.
