I think I may have read this wrong and just went up to the top of Stewart Mountain on my MTB.  I stopped part way up to take off my jacket/glasses/etc and had enough of a rest that I cleared a rocky section that had me pushing the bike up every other time.

From the top, I took Tom's Trail for the first time off the hill.  Trail Forks has it listed as black, the new CRD signage has it as blue.  Regardless, I explored this route carefully; not the time of the year to fall on that terrain.   

This was a fun ride.  I considered taking the TT bike off the trainer but the air is still too cold when an MTB ride is an option.

Time: **105 Mins** &nbsp; Swim: **2100m** &nbsp; Run: **10.4 km**

A better sleep last night but the knot in my trap is still aggravated.

Got the workout done just before the ropes were moved from 50m to 25m.  I found a groove on the 12th of 16 lengths (800m rep); I wish I could have held on to that groove longer.

I ran south of the pool this afternoon with the goals of getting in some hills, keeping it easy and drawing a GPS track that never intersects.  Got all three goals checked off and I **felt really good** in doing so.
