A better sleep last night but the knot in my trap is still aggravated.

Got the workout done just but the ropes were moved from 50m to 25m.  I found a groove on the 12th of 16 lengths (800m rep); I wish I could have held on to that groove longer.

I ran south of the pool this afternoon with the goals of getting in some hills, keeping it easy and drawing a GPS track that never intersects.  Got all three goals checked off and I **felt really good** in doing so.
