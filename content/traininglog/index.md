<!--description: My training log is a series of weekly updates aimed at sharing my experience as I build toward completing my first IRONMAN distance triathon.-->

This section of my website is a week by week account of my
experience in the build up toward completing my FIRST IRONMAN 
distance triathlon.  I hope it is relevant for:

* Friends and family wanting to know why I can't do [_some activity_] on weekends anymore.
* Those embarked on their own similar journey and want to read about my process.
* My boss who may be wondering _"the real reason"_ we are getting too close to our project's deadline.

Most importantly, this training log is relevant for me, as a 
record my experiences, the hurdles I face, the victories won 
and importanly, the bonds formed along the way.

For a bit of context, I am approaching my 50th bithday and do 
not have a great amount of endurance sport experience.  I do
have the desire to see this journey to this next finish line.

My [current training week](latest) can be found [here](latest).
