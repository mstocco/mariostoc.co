## ABOUT THIS TRAINING LOG

I kept a paper training journal when I was younger; I still have most of those notes today and it is fun for me to re-read them.

With the goal of an Ironman ahead of me, I thought it would be a good idea to start writing things down again; instead of paper, I created this digital format.


### RELAVENCY
I hope it is relevant for:

<ul class="alt">
<li>Friends and family wanting to know why I can't do <em>"name an activity"</em> on weekends anymore.</li>
<li>Those embarked on their own similar journey and want to read about my process.</li>
<li>My boss who may be wondering <em>"the real reason"</em> we are getting too close to our project's deadline.</li>
</ul>

Most importantly, this training log is relevant for me, as a record my experiences, the hurdles I face, the victories won and importanly, the bonds formed along the way.

### SOME CONTEXT ABOUT ME
I am approaching my 50th bithday and do not have a great amount of endurance sport experience.  I do have the desire to see this journey across an Ironman red carpet.

### ORGANIZATION
I took the date of IRONMAN Canada-Penticton, August 29, 2021 and worked back from there, creating a web page for every training week, 52 weeks in all.

Each webpage dedicated to a training week will contain a WEEKLY GOAL, a SUMMARY and notes from SUNDAY to SATURDAY (the scheduled workouts, what I completed and importantly, how I felt).

There is a [calendar page](calendar) that gives you quick access to any completed week and highlights and special dates relative to my Ironman training.

The following link will take you to my current training week:
