# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, March 7, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**25 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
It looks like from the works out, I will spend this week slowly coming back from the back injury.

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was:  
**&rarr TWO STEPS FORWARD**   
**&larr; ONE STEP BACK**

I thought I had a good week for being on the mend.  I got a little over an hour of running in, lots of walking and a bit of time on the bike.  I had a really good day on [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');) but sadly, I had a QL flare up on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');).

I thought I was getting a handle on a really tough project at work but any inertia I had at the beginning of the week was gone by [Friday](javascript('fri');).

Light, 1km jog to _The Athlete Centre_ felt ok.

Light jog from _TAC_ back home and I felt fantastic!

After work, I put the trainers back on and started with my 15 minute walk; zero back issues.  Once the run began, I ran easy and focused on the breath work that I had gone over with Michelle earlier.  I wasn't focused on pace but looking back at the Garmin activity, I was around my marathon pace.  What I did notice afterwards was that my high hamstring soreness was gone.  That would be amazing if I have found a solution to that run limiter.

Solid swim this afternoon.  I had fresh tips from Elliot on where my swim stroke is breaking down.  With that knowledge, I was able to be more cognizant of where my hands finish at the end of the workout.  Last 100m cool down effort came in at 1:53; I am pretty happy with that as I am pretty sure that is an improvement.

The walk was to the _McKenzie Interchange_ and back.  My back feels good and I am happy to be walking as both of my gracilis muscles are very sore from yesterday.

Tough day mentally.  This project at work is proving to be a challenge.  My motivation and ability to concentrate fell like a stone today and I wasn't into going outside for a ride.  I sat on the trainer instead; spinning easily upright for the first 30 minutes, then 10 minutes in the aerobars to test the back (the last 5 minutes upright again).  I felt good and focused on breathing for the majority of the time pedalling.

I spent some time massaging out my still very tender gracilis muscles before dinner.

### NOTES

My QL decided that it is not as ready to play ball yet and gave me a pretty solid pang to let me know.  I seriously don't know whether to scream or cry.

I walked for 90 minutes and skipped the bike ride.
