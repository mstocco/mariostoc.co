<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Ride 3:00. Base miles. Easy to steady effort. 
Goals: Fueling. Hydrating. Staying warm. Covering ground/Distance. 
TT bike on Peninsula or MTB on Goose. 

2nd: Off the bike: Run 20 minutes EASY. Really easy. 
Testing: Ride fueling. Ride hydration. Your guts (literally).

### NOTES
Total Time: **183 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **61.3 km**

Afternoon spin out to [Roche Cove](javascript:flkty.select(2);) on the XC bike.  I locked out the suspension and it made a difference.  Weather started warm but the increasing cloud blew in, it got cooler; even had the odd rain drop on the way home.

Packed 3 bottles, 2 with my [lemonade recipe](/blog/lemonade-recipe).  90g per bottle mix with no gut issues at ~125 BPM effort; confident that I could go sweeter.
<!----->
Legs felt tired during the start of the ride, then felt good through the second hour.  My sit bones were the sorest body part rolling into hour three.

I was on dinner duty when I got home so, no run off the bike.  5 minutes before the ride ended, my legs felt like a run off the bike would NOT be productive.  5 minutes after I got home, my legs felt like that run would have been pretty doable.  After standing in the kitchen cooking for an hour, my legs had enough and I needed to sit down.

Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT

MTB fun. 
1:45 on the MTB. 
Head into the hills. 
On the flats: Easy. Spinning to warm up/cool down.
On the downhills: Fun and safe. 
On the Uphill's: Strong effort. All clear to let your HR get up. 
You can chose 1-3 longer hills. This is NOT a race uphill. But, you should be getting the HR up, the respiratory rate up, and start wondering where the top of these darn climbs are. 
*Fuel! Still do this. Even on an MTB ride.
