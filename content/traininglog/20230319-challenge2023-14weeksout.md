## SUNDAY MAR 19 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
1st: Ride 3:00. Base miles. Easy to steady effort. 
Goals: Fueling. Hydrating. Staying warm. Covering 
ground/Distance.  TT bike on Peninsula or MTB on Goose. 

2nd: Off the bike: Run 20 minutes EASY. Really easy. 
Testing: Ride fueling. Ride hydration. Your guts 
(literally).

### NOTES
Total Time: **183 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **61.3 km**

Afternoon spin out to [Roche Cove](javascript:flkty.select(2);) 
on the XC bike.  I locked out the suspension and it made a 
difference.  Weather started warm but the increasing cloud 
blew in, it got cooler; even had the odd rain drop on the way 
home.

Packed 3 bottles, 2 with my [lemonade recipe](/blog/lemonade-recipe). 
90g per bottle mix with no gut issues at ~125 BPM effort; confident 
that I could go sweeter.
<!----->
Legs felt tired during the start of the ride, then felt good 
through the second hour.  My sit bones were the sorest body 
part rolling into hour three.

I was on dinner duty when I got home so, no run off the bike. 
5 minutes before the ride ended, my legs felt like a run off 
the bike would NOT be productive.  5 minutes after I got home, 
my legs felt like that run would have been pretty doable. 
After standing in the kitchen cooking for an hour, my legs had 
enough and I needed to sit down.

## TUESDAY MAR 21
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2100: 
2 rounds (100 easy free/smooth. R :20, 50 steady kick. R :20) 
2x 50 Paddle-fist drill w/ focus on high elbow catch. R :20. 
4x 100 descend 1-4. R :20. #1: IM effort, #2: ¬Ω IM effort, #3: 
1500 effort. #4. 750 effort. R :25 after each. 2x 50 EASY.
21x50 as 2 @ Strong-high turnover-high focus, 1 @ EASY.  R :15 
after each. 150 super relaxed and easy to cool down. 

Pre-Run: Dead bugs, Glute Bridges, 45 Planks  
Run 60 minutes. Purposely hilly effort. 
Cedar hills is great. But so are a bunch of routes. Just make 
sure the effort is easy, but the terrain/route is challenging.

### NOTES
Time: **137 Mins** &nbsp; Swim: **2200m** &nbsp; Run: **10.0 km**

I got 2000m of long course in before the rope change. There 
was 9 minutes of rest before restarting in a 25m lane.

<!----->
Felt ok in the water, right deltoid a bit irritated; ended 
with 2 focused sessions in.

I ran from the pool using Summit Avenue and The Rise as my 
purposely hilly route.  Effort was easy, running felt easy 
after a few minutes and once off the hill and back to the flat 
road near the pool, I felt really strong.

Solid afternoon.

## WEDNESDAY MAR 22
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 3:00. Base miles. Easy to steady effort or...  

1:45 on the MTB. Head into the hills.  On the flats: Easy. 
Spinning to warm up/cool down. On the downhills: Fun and safe. 
On the Uphill's: Strong effort. All clear to let your HR get 
up. You can chose 1-3 longer hills. This is NOT a race uphill 
but, you should be getting the HR up, the respiratory rate up, 
and start wondering where the top of these darn climbs are.  
&bull; Fuel! Still do this. Even on an MTB ride. 

Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **130 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride: **Inside**

Time was not on my side this afternoon.

I needed to pick up Carina at _Harbour Air_ right in what 
would have been the middle of a 3 hour ride.
<!----->
Instead, I rode the trainer twice; once late afternoon and 
once after dinner.

I loaded the Fulgaz app on the Apple TV then rode segments of 
the simulated St. George 70.3 course.  Of the 3 big hills, I 
got up and over the first two smaller hills (there looks to be 
a BIG hill near the end).

First session was 64 minutes (139W NP)  

Second session was 66 minutes (140W NP)

Fulgaz (the app) crashed around the 55 minute point of the 
second ride. I was recording the effort with my Garmin Edge 
and it took over driving the smart trainer and I rode 
free-ride for the next 10 minutes.

45 minutes of total running. Whatever is easy and fun.

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **2800m** &nbsp;Run: **6.2 km**

I didn't even try to cram lengths into a 50m lane.

I went a bit later and did this workout SCM. It was productive 
time in the water and 8x200m were focused, fun and challenging.

<!----->
The weather is cold, windy and threatening to rain. I haven't 
run on dirt in a while, so to prevent a niggle, I decided to 
drive back home and run from there.

Oh the irony...

The run started out as laboured, heavy legs for the first 11 
minutes before I found a rhythm.  It was fun from that point 
right up to 40 minutes when I rolled my right ankle on a rut 
that I didn't see.

I hobbled home.
