# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, August 21, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**RACE WEEK**

## WEEKLY GOAL
Get myself to _Penticton_ ready<br /><sup>(focus on only what I can control)</sup>

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **6 Hours**

I feel like I was **READY A WEEK AGO**

Bit of a busy week with Carina's family visiting from Germany, a visit with my family in Osoyoos on Thursday, packing for a triathlon, the drive to the Okanagan.

Through all of it, we got to Penticton with a bit of time to breathe.

Next up is to have fun.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Remember to fuel before/during/after each session. And hydrate too!‚Äã**

1st: Open Water Swim ~ 2x 2:30 EASY swimming to warm up. Rest as needed. 
3x 10 minutes @ IM effort/focus. R 2:00 after each. 3 minutes easy swimming to stretch out and cool down. 

2nd: Run 16km. Flat route. Easy effort. Cover ground. Nothing more than that. Bring your calories. Bring your water. If you want to head up island to get a bit of heat, that is allowed.

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **16.2 km**

The cooler breeze off the water certainly helped as I made my way to _James Bay_ to the end of the _Ogden Point Breakwater_.  From the start, I found a really good rhythm and held it pretty much the entire run.
<!----->
Maybe the easiest 10 miles I've run in a long time.  I packed a 500ml water bottle with some diluted lemonade sludge (left over from the ride yesterday) and sipped often.

With family commitments, I didn't make it to the lake.

At the end of a long day, I felt like I had gone for a run but not wrecked, happy and ready for sleep.

Afterwork, I spent some time futzing with little things on the bike.  Adding the water bottle cage that I modified for the Victoria 70.3 for example.

A short spin on the TT Bike out toward _Colwood_ before coming back through _Esquimalt_.

I really wasn't feeling it on my feet however.  Sore ankles and some nerve pain in my little toe.  I cut this one short and walked home.

### NOTES
Total Time: **89 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **1500m** &nbsp;Ride: **14 km**

_Crystal Pool_ is still having issues with their filtration system so I rode the race bike to _Esquimalt Rec._. Their bike rack was full so I had to lock my bike up a bit away; that didn't sit well with me.
<!----->
In the pool and did the first 35 minutes of the workout; just enough to be comfortable in the water and get back to my bike.  I wouldn't have been able to forgive myself if someone had got through the bike lock.

A short ride on the bike there after.  I did re-install the new chain by re-adding a link and using a KMC quick-link.  The chain is very quiet except for what I think maybe that quick-link... 

Here is the race setup:

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Travel to Osoyoos. ~ 8-9 hours.

Mobility 25 minutes

Run/Walk 40 minutes: 10 minutes walking to loosen up. Run 25 minutes. Flat and easy. 5 minutes walking to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **40 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **5.4 km**

The travel to Osoyoos went well but driving that distance did light up my right hamstring/piriformis.

Once in town, I did the 10 minute walk followed by the run.  Right away the heat and dry air was felt but before I was a kilometre in, I really felt like I was in my element.  All systems go, I **felt fantastic!**

I ran for ~30 minutes before shutting things down.

5 minutes easy swimming to cool down/relax. 

Mobility 20 minutes

Athlete Check-in: **1PM - 2PM** 

### NOTES
Total Swim Time: **25 Minutes**

Very late night visiting with my aunt.

Rolling into town around noon, we parked on _Lakeshore _ and I went straight to the event check-in.  Number 1244 reminded me of the 1355 I had at the [Victoria 70.3](/racereports/2022-)

I thought about putting on my wetsuit but instead, got into the water with just my racekit.  Swim was easy effort, the water was comfortable, not overly warm but reportedly just over the 24.4¬∞C limit.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Solid breakfast/Lunch. Hydrate well all day, try to stay out of the sun/heat‚Äã**

Final bike spin out ~ 45 minutes. Easy spinning. 
Making sure everything works. Keep it easy. Flat is preferred, but you should go through the gears and make sure the bike works heading uphill/downhill.

### NOTES
Total Ride Time: **10 Minutes**

Weather was quite cool and windy.

Not much of a ride.  I started with my bike in the garage of the property we we staying at.  There was a small tick, tick, tick that I was confident was the KMC Quick-link.  I replaced that with an official Shimano link and the noise disappeared.  With the bike ready, stickers on, I rolled down to the race venue with Pattie.  I could have rolled around town for a half-hour or so but it really may have made the anticipation of [tomorrow](/racereports/2022-ironman-canada) even more amplified.

I racked my bike and went for lunch (burger at _The Patio_).

For dinner, I had a Pok√© Bowl (tuna) and I was in bed at a decent time.
