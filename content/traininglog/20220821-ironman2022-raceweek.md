# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, August 21, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**RACE WEEK**

## WEEKLY GOAL
Get myself to _Penticton_ ready<br /><sup>(focus on only what I can control)</sup>

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **6 Hours**

I feel like I was **READY A WEEK AGO**

Bit of a busy week with Carina's family visiting from Germany, a visit with my family in Osoyoos on Thursday, packing for a triathlon, the drive to the Okanagan.

Through all of it, we got to Penticton with a bit of time to breathe.

Next up is to have fun.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Remember to fuel before/during/after each session. And hydrate too!​**

1st: Open Water Swim ~ 2x 2:30 EASY swimming to warm up. Rest as needed. 
3x 10 minutes @ IM effort/focus. R 2:00 after each. 3 minutes easy swimming to stretch out and cool down. 

2nd: Run 16km. Flat route. Easy effort. Cover ground. Nothing more than that. Bring your calories. Bring your water. If you want to head up island to get a bit of heat, that is allowed.

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **16.2 km**

The cooler breeze off the water certainly helped as I made my way to _James Bay_ to the end of the _Ogden Point Breakwater_.  From the start, I found a really good rhythm and held it pretty much the entire run.
<!----->
Maybe the easiest 10 miles I've run in a long time.  I packed a 500ml water bottle with some diluted lemonade sludge (left over from the ride yesterday) and sipped often.

With family commitments, I didn't make it to the lake.

At the end of a long day, I felt like I had gone for a run but not wrecked, happy and ready for sleep.

Afterwork, I spent some time futzing with little things on the bike.  Adding the water bottle cage that I modified for the Victoria 70.3 for example.

A short spin on the TT Bike out toward _Colwood_ before coming back through _Esquimalt_.

I really wasn't feeling it on my feet however.  Sore ankles and some nerve pain in my little toe.  I cut this one short and walked home.

### NOTES

_Crystal Pool_ is still having issues with their filtration system so I rode the race bike to _Esquimalt Rec._. Their bike rack was full so I had to lock my bike up a bit away; that didn't sit well with me.
<!----->
In the pool and did the first 35 minutes of the workout; just enough to be comfortable in the water and get back to my bike.  I wouldn't have been able to forgive myself if someone had got through the bike lock.

---

A short ride on the bike there after.  I did re-install the new chain by re-adding a link and using a KMC quick-link.  The chain is very quiet except for what I think maybe that quick-link... 

Here is the race setup:

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Travel to Osoyoos. ~ 8-9 hours.

Mobility 25 minutes

Run/Walk 40 minutes: 10 minutes walking to loosen up. Run 25 minutes. Flat and easy. 5 minutes walking to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **40 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **5.4 km**

Made it on to the 7am sailing.

The travel to Osoyoos went well but driving that distance did light up my hamstring/piriformis (typical right side).

Once in town, I did the 10 minute walk followed by the run.  Right away the heat and dry air was felt but before I was a kilometre in, I really felt like I was in my element.
<!---->
Starting at the _Main Street Bridge_, I ran the _Pioneer Walkway_, then ironically down _Lakeshore Drive_.  I turned around after 15 minutes and caught back up with my family on the way back.

Short run but just what was needed.

All systems go, I **felt fantastic!**

Mobility 20 minutes

Athlete Check-in: **1PM - 2PM** 

### NOTES
Total Swim Time: **25 Minutes**

Very late night visiting with my aunt.

Rolling into town around noon, we parked on _Lakeshore Drive_ and I went straight to the event check-in.  Number 1244 reminded me of the 1355 I had at the [Victoria 70.3](/racereports/2022-ironman-70.3-victoria).
<!----->
I thought about putting on my wetsuit but instead, got into the water with just my tri-suit.  Swim was easy effort, the water clear and the temperate was comfortable, not overly warm but reportedly just over the 24.4°C limit.

I wore a new pair of goggles for the first time; they are super clear and good to go.

A large, delicious poké bowl (salmon) for a late lunch.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Solid breakfast/Lunch. Hydrate well all day, try to stay out of the sun/heat​**

Final bike spin out ~ 45 minutes. Easy spinning. 
Making sure everything works. Keep it easy. Flat is preferred, but you should go through the gears and make sure the bike works heading uphill/downhill.

### NOTES
Total Ride Time: **10 Minutes**

Weather in _Penticton_ today was cooler than _Victoria_.  A northerly wind blew all day as well. 


I started my day with in the garage of the property we we staying at.  Race stickers applied and I needed to address the small tick, tick, tick in the chain noticed on [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');).  I replaced the quick-link with an official Shimano link and the noise disappeared.
<!----->
With the bike ready, I rolled down to the race venue with Pattie from _Austin, Texas_.  That took just 10 minutes so not really a ride.  

I could have rolled around town for 40 minutes but that may have made the anticipation of [tomorrow](/racereports/2022-ironman-canada-penticton) even more amplified.

I racked my bike and met Carina for lunch (burger at _The Patio_). She took the opportunity to go shopping and take in a winery.  I hung out in our room and had an afternoon nap.

For dinner, I had another poké bowl (tuna this time) and I was in bed at a decent time.
