### PLANNED WORKOUT
**Remember to fuel before/during/after each session. And hydrate too!‚Äã**

1st: Open Water Swim ~ 2x 2:30 EASY swimming to warm up. Rest as needed. 
3x 10 minutes @ IM effort/focus. R 2:00 after each. 3 minutes easy swimming to stretch out and cool down. 

2nd: Run 16km. Flat route. Easy effort. Cover ground. Nothing more than that. Bring your calories. Bring your water. If you want to head up island to get a bit of heat, that is allowed.

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **16.2 km**

The cooler breeze off the water certainly helped as I made my way to _James Bay_ to the end of the _Ogden Point Breakwater_.  From the start, I found a really good rhythm and held it pretty much the entire run.
<!----->
Maybe the easiest 10 miles I've run in a long time.  I packed a 500ml water bottle with some diluted lemonade sludge (left over from the ride yesterday) and sipped often.

With family commitments, I didn't make it to the lake.

At the end of a long day, I felt like I had gone for a run but not wrecked, happy and ready for sleep.
