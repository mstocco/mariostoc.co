### PLANNED WORKOUT
&midast; flipped from [yesterday](challenge2023-22weeksout?sat)

**Dead bugs, breathing, glute bridges.**  
Trainer ~ 30-45 minutes. EASY effort. Keep the HR low. 
Breaking a sweat is ok, but under no circumstance should this feel harder than a walk.

Stretching 22 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Mins** &nbsp; Avg HR: **105 BPM**

Hit the trainer at halftime of the Chief/Bengals game.  Pedalled easy for 45 minutes; everything felt normal with zero ill-effects.

Stretched afterwards (much needed).  My back (QL/right side) was acting in a bad way; it felt like it would go into a full spasm if I wasn't careful. It didn't.  
&rarr;Extra water before going to bed.

Hint of a headache (just a 2 out of 10) and a nagging, occasional dry cough are the final holdout symptoms from last week.

My back is feeling less precarious this morning.
