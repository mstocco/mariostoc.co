Sleep **2** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&midast; flipped from [yesterday](challenge2023-22weeksout?sat)

**Dead bugs, breathing, glute bridges.**  
Trainer ~ 30-45 minutes. EASY effort. Keep the HR low. 
Breaking a sweat is ok, but under no circumstance should this feel harder than a walk.

Stretching 22 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **45 Mins** &nbsp; Avg HR: **105 BPM**

Hit the trainer at halftime of the Chief/Bengals game.  Pedalled easy for 45 minutes; everything felt normal with zero ill-effects.

Stretched afterwards (much needed).  My back (QL/right side) was acting in a bad way; it felt like it would go into a full spasm if I wasn't careful. It didn't.  
&rarr;Extra water before going to bed.

### NOTES

Hint of a headache (just a 2 out of 10) and a nagging, occasional dry cough are the final holdout symptoms from last week.

My back is feeling less precarious this morning.

Walked with Carina but just 35 minutes and not the full hour.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Bike: Dead bugs, breathing, and glute bridges.

Trainer ~ 60 minutes. Easy effort. Just spin the legs. Nothing more than that!

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **128W**

Still congested this morning, still bothered by this weird cough.

I set an alarm on my head unit to warn at 120BPM, then set the simulated grade to 0% (level road) and spun my legs for an hour.  Got the beep a couple times and backed off a touch.  Felt pretty good.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Pre-Swim: Dead bugs, breathing, and glute bridges.

2 rounds (100 easy swim, 100 w/ buoy, 50 steady kick. Rest as needed) 
4 rounds (50 Shark-fin drill. R :20, 200 aerobic/smooth w/ exaggerated rotation. R :45)

2x 50 EASY to cool down.

2nd: Run 25 minutes EASY

### NOTES
Total Time: **67 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **1800m** &nbsp;Run: **4.7 km**

A lot less congested upon waking but that nag of a cough persists.

Back to the scene of the crime; it was a bit weird being at _Crystal Pool_.
<!----->
It's been a while since I've swam on a Wednesday afternoon and how many lanes the kids programs take up at 1600.  Everyone moved into the slow lane.  Instead of crawling over people, I called it a workout, with 200m to go.

What I missed in the pool, I added on the run.  I **felt pretty good** on the bike path down to the _Selkirk Trestle_.   Carina, on her bike commute home, kept me company for my return trip.  This was written as all-caps EASY but I felt like going faster and did the last half as a build to a strong finish. ![Run](/assets/jpg/run-20230201.jpeg) 
The effort was enough to get Garmin to estimate my Lactate Threshold at 155 bpm and a pace of 5:03 /km.  Identical to this time last year.  The last time I ran with enough time/intensity to trigger a reading was last April.

## THURSDAY FEB 2 üå§
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT

8x 1:30 in a big gear/low cadence/high torque....165-200 watt range...no erg mode, 1:30 normal spinning between each. 
15 minutes easy spinning to cool down/finish up.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **0W**

With the bit of intensity to during the run [yesterday](javascript:flick('wed');), today was going to be interesting.  Good news this morning; congestion is less, the weird cough is still there but no other ill effects.

Muscles are a bit stiff, shoulders (swim) and quads (run) but those are positives.
