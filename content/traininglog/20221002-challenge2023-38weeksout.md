# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, October 2, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**38** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Simply to start the rhythm of the next build.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **0 Hours**

I feel like I was **PATIENTLY STARTING AGAIN**

2 swims, 2 runs and a bit of time on the new smart trainer made up this week in training.  Every workout seemly appropriate for  where I am after 5 weeks off.

Sleep was good all week too.  I was in bed early, up early and my focus at work was on point.

Weight gain from the time off is bothering me.

1600m seemed to me to be the perfect distance to start again in the pool.  It felt god to be back in the water too.  _Crystal Pool_ has fixed their filter issue too.  I drove to the pool as I was late pushing away from the keyboard (work) this afternoon.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Trainer test!
50 minutes. Easy spinning on the trainer. 
Feel free to program an "easy" workout. 
Aka-10 minutes @ 100 watts, 10 minutes @ 130 watts, 10 minutes @ 110 watts, ect. 
And see how it works. As long as it's easy, it works for me.

Mobility 25 minutes 

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 Minutes** &nbsp; Ride Type: **Smart Trainer**

First ride with ERG mode; time went by fast.  Looks like  I can set custom power ranges or I can select power zones based of what Garmin thinks I am capable of.  Garmin's Zone 1 (0-53W) is way too easy, Zone 2 (53-117W) is warm-up/easy spinning for me.  Zone 3 (117-160W) is work where I am feeling a burn in my quads, wet from sweat but not necessarily breathing hard.

Manual control (outside a programmed workout) gives me trainer resistance in 10% jumps and I am not ready to spend time above 10% (example 20% is really hard today).

<!----->

### A VERY SAD DAY

I just got word that my family got a little smaller today.

**Frankie Cicchitano**, I am very thankful that we got to re-connect at your sister's wedding just two weeks ago.  Rest in peace.

### NOTES
<mark>Total Time: **0 Minutes** </mark>

No one specific thing that I can think of but my QL decided to get very angry today.  Did the stretching plus some extra movement on the yoga mat but the run is being pushed out until [tomorrow](challenge2023-37weeksout?sun).

Frustrating.
