# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, October 23, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**35** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Get _"back"_ to training, slowly.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **0 Hours**

I feel like I was **PAST PRECARIOUS**

This week was done with an abundance of caution to give my back a chance at getting healthy.  By the time [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) rolled around, my back was in a much better spot.

I was consistent with the workouts and got a big win at work on [Friday](javascript:flick('fri');) too.

The weather is certainly wintertime in the PNW.

**Breathing and deadbugs before the ride**      
Ride 60 minutes easy on the trainer. Nice and light. Only add resistance if you feel warmed up and comfortable. 

Mobility 15 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Trainer: **128W**

One hour, mostly on the bullhorns, and mostly around ~120W.  I don't know how accurate the zones are set up for me but Garmin marked a good amount of my time in Z3.  Lower back held up, but the bruised tissue is still sore.

I felt every stroke with my right arm in my mid-back.  1500m was about the most that injury site was willing to take.  Spent time in the hot tub afterwards too.

I drove to and from the pool; parking a bit away to get some steps in.

Once on deck, saw that the 50m lanes were still in.  I jumped in and swam 300m easy before the change over.  It wasn't long for the lifeguards to get the 25m lanes set up an once they finished, I started today's workout from the start.  The swim clubs started at 1600 and 200m into the last of rep of the main set, the clock was 1559.  I called it a day and headed to the hot tub and put a jet on my lumber.

Rode to and from the pool.
