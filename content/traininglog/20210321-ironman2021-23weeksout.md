# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, March 21, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**23 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am expecting work to be more predictable this week.  My goal is to stay on task with Elliot's schedule and recover some of the hip mobility lost over the last month. 

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

## SUNDAY MAR 21 ðŸŒ§
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.   
75 minutes on your feet: Walk 10 minutes, focus on your breathing. THEN... 60 minutes of flat and easy running. No need to focus on your breathing during the run. 5 minute walk to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Jog Time: **60 minutes** &nbsp; Step Count: **17,362**

Flat and easy for an hour put me at 10 km for the day (not including the walk time).  My legs felt dead for all but the last kilometre; nothing specific and certainly nothing acute, just legs that could be remembering yesterday's ride.

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 minutes**

It wasn't the warmest of mornings but I did hit a few green lights and pedalled to Crystal Pool in just 9 minutes.

The pool workout was swam short by 200m or 4 minutes.  There was a bit more congestion in the _Continuous Lane_ this morning and I think in the confusion, I missed a couple of 100m reps.  I moved over to the _Fast Lane_ and finished the back half of the workout there (probably should have just started in that lane).

There was a really nice sunrise to enjoy on the commute home.
