# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, March 21, 2021](javascript:flick('sun');)

**23 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am expecting work to be more predictable this week.  My goal is to stay on task with Elliot's schedule and recover some of the hip mobility lost over the last month. 

## SUMMARY
I feel I like was...

## SUNDAY MAR 21 üåß
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.   
75 minutes on your feet: Walk 10 minutes, focus on your breathing. THEN... 60 minutes of flat and easy running. No need to focus on your breathing during the run. 5 minute walk to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Jog Time: **60 minutes** &nbsp; Step Count: **17,362**

Flat and easy jog for an hour put me at 10 km for the day (not including the walk time).

My **legs felt dead** for all but the last kilometre; nothing specific and certainly nothing acute, just legs with the memory of [yesterday's ride](ironman2021-24weeksout?sat).

Walking past the soccer field on the way home, a group of Italian exchange students had organized a pickup game against some other teenagers.  I had to stop a watch; **Che forza!**

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 minutes**

Early start today.

It wasn't the warmest of mornings but I did hit a few green lights and pedalled my XC bike to Crystal Pool in just 9 minutes.
<!---->
The pool workout was swam short by 200m or 4 minutes.  There was a bit more congestion in the _Continuous Lane_ this morning and I think in the confusion, I missed a couple of 100m reps.  I moved over to the _Fast Lane_ and finished the back half of the workout there (probably should have just started in that lane).

There was a really nice sunrise to enjoy on the commute home.

## TUESDAY MAR 23 ‚õÖÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.  &nbsp; 60 minutes on your feet: 10 minutes walking to warm up. Focus on your breathing while walking. Run 50 minutes. Flat route. Easy effort. Focus on your form while running. Find a comfortable rhythm.

### NOTES
Run Time: **50 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **5 miles**

My QL is tight(er) this morning.  Being honest with myself, there is still some healing needed.

I walked 15 minutes to _Swan Lake_.  When I reached the dirt path, I hit start on the watch to record the run.  It was easy pace, nothing more and when I finished the first loop, I went around the lake again.  My **legs felt heavy** but my QL was unbothered.  Getting back on to the bike path, I found a bit of a rhythm and just like the run on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');), the last kilometre was my comfortable kilometre.

## WEDNESDAY MAR 24 üåß
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 2 TAC Routine.
5:30am: Swim (50m) 2100: 
2 rounds (4x 50 Steady swim w/ strong finish to stroke r :20. 3x 50 kick w/ tight kick. r :15)

450 continuous/steady rhythm. 50 easy kick. (Bring the board back) 2x 50 easy free to cool down. 
Short ride to the pool. Slightly longer ride home. About 30-40 minutes of total time spinning for the day.

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 minutes**

Probably my best swim so far this year for no other reason than it **felt good**.  9:06 for 450m and 1:50 for the final 100m.  The 0530 time slot at Crystal Pool was much busier today.

Apart from feeling good, I as felt immersed in the activity; good workout coach! 

<!---->
On another note, ALL of the 50m time slots are booked through April.  With the exception of next week, I just lost the oppertunity to swim at Crystal Pool.  Bookings for May open on April 19th and are expected to be sold out in minutes according to reception.  Not cool, especially after how things were working for me this morning.

## THURSDAY MAR 25
Sleep **1** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Day 1 TAC Routine.  
Ride 60-70 minutes on the road or MTB. Ideally this is outside and relatively flat. If you're back is feeling good, you could ride the water front or something similar. But you're also good to stick to the Lochside/Goose to keep the stress on your back to a minimum.   
40 minutes on your feet. 5 minutes walking to warm up. 30 minutes flat and easy running. Focus on your rhythm. Walk 5 minutes to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Sleep was marked down as **one** today because I had a solid nap before dinner last night.  I also rode on the trainer after dinner and the check-in with my back this morning is good news!
