### NOTES

Today may be worse than [yesterday](challenge2023-23weeksout?sat).

Every symptom listed in an over-the-counter cold medication commercial, yes every one, experienced.  Switched to Neocitron in the afternoon; it's less effective for me.  Advil before bed.

### NOTES

Waking up to a new day.  I am no longer leaking through my face like yesterday.  My throat is still ridiculously sore.  Advil is keeping me sane.

A bit of a dry cough is developing this afternoon.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Still need Advil to get over the pain in my left tonsil.  Not much of a cough which might be my best news so far.

2 Advil before bed to try and get through a full night's sleep.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Total Time: **35 Minutes** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **?**

First full day without Advil.

Throat is still very sore but I am nearing the end of this setback.  

Set the alarm on the head unit to beep if I get out of HR Z1 and then pedalled **very easy**; just enough to start a sweat and zero stress beyond that.

## THURSDAY JAN 26 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash;  

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

I woke up with a headache which feels like a hangover.  It very well could be a withdrawal symptom given the Advil Train I was riding to start this week and that I quit it cold turkey yesterday.  I am still mildly congested and my throat is mildly sore.

Late afternoon, I needed to get some sleep.  Headache and chills evident that this bug hasn't been beat yet.

No Advil.  The sleep helped.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Late afternoon walk with Carina.

### NOTES
Total Time: **~30 Minutes**

Similar to yesterday morning, I am still mildly congested and my throat is mildly sore.  Let's hope that I can make it through today without the mid-afternoon downturn.

Walk with Carina before dinner was nice.

## SATURDAY JAN 28 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Sat: 1/28
Pre-Bike: Dead bugs, breathing, and Glute Bridges.

Trainer ~ 30-45 minutes. EASY effort. Keep the HR low. 
Breaking a sweat is ok, but under no circumstance should this feel harder than a walk.

Stretching 22 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **?W**

Woke up at 0530 with a headache.  Felt light a caffeine withdrawal headache but I had a cup of coffee yesterday; it might be an Advil withdrawal headache or this virus is proving to have some fight in it.  I am congested (nasal) too.
