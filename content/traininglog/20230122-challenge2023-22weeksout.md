Today may be worse than [yesterday](challenge2023-23weeksout?sat).

Every symptom listed in an over-the-counter cold medication commercial, yes every one, experienced.  Switched to Neocitron in the afternoon; it's less effective for me.  Advil before bed.

### NOTES

Waking up to a new day.  I am no longer leaking through my face like yesterday.  My throat is still ridiculously sore.  Advil is keeping me sane.

A bit of a dry cough is developing this afternoon.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Still need Advil to get over the pain in my left tonsil.  Not much of a cough which might be my best news so far.

2 Advil before bed to try and get through a full night's sleep.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Total Time: **35 Minutes** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **?**

First full day without Advil.

Throat is still very sore but I am nearing the end of this setback.  

Set the alarm on the head unit to beep if I get out of HR Z1 and then pedalled **very easy**; just enough to start a sweat and zero stress beyond that.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash;  

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

I woke up with a headache which feels like a hangover.  It very well could be a withdrawal symptom given the Advil Train I was riding to start this week and that I quit it cold turkey yesterday.  I am still mildly congested and my throat is mildly sore.

Late afternoon, I needed to get some sleep.  Headache and chills evident that this bug hasn't been beat yet.

No Advil.  The sleep helped.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Late afternoon walk with Carina.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Similar to yesterday morning, I am still mildly congested and my throat is mildly sore.  Let's hope that I can make it through today without the mid-afternoon downturn.
