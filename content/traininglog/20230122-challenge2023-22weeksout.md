# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, January 22, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**22** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Shake this virus.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **2 Hours**

I feel like I was **SICK AS A DOG**

Where last week, I felt frustrated and annoyed for getting catching COVID, this week, the reality of this situation hit home.

I honestly thought that I was going to be over this by [Monday](javascript:flick('mon');) at the latest.

My first activity of this week was a super easy session on the trainer on [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');).  That put me on the back foot for [Thursday](javascript:flick('thu');).

Even on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');), I was still less than 100%.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Today may be worse than [yesterday](challenge2023-23weeksout?sat).

Every symptom listed in an over-the-counter cold medication commercial, yes every one, experienced.  Switched to Neocitron in the afternoon; it's less effective for me.  Advil before bed.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES

Waking up to a new day.  I am no longer leaking through my face like yesterday.  My throat is still ridiculously sore.  Advil is keeping me sane.

A bit of a dry cough is developing this afternoon.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash;  

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

Still need Advil to get over the pain in my left tonsil.  Not much of a cough which might be my best news so far.

2 Advil before bed to try and get through a full night's sleep.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash;  

### NOTES
Total Time: **35 Minutes** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **100W**

First full day without Advil.

Throat is still very sore but I am nearing the end of this setback.  

Set the alarm on the head unit to beep if I get out of HR Z1 and then pedalled **very easy**; just enough to start a sweat and zero stress beyond that.

## THURSDAY JAN 26 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

<h3 style="color:red;border-top:1px solid red;margin-bottom:24px;">STILL FIGHTING COVID</h3>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash;  

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes**

I woke up with a headache which feels like a hangover.  It very well could be a withdrawal symptom given the Advil Train I was riding to start this week and that I quit it cold turkey yesterday.  I am still mildly congested and my throat is mildly sore.

Late afternoon, I needed to get some sleep.  Headache and chills evident that this bug hasn't been beat yet.

No Advil.  The sleep helped.

## FRIDAY JAN 27 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

<h3 style="color:orange;border-top:1px solid orange;margin-bottom:24px;">RECOVERING FROM COVID</h3>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Late afternoon walk with Carina.

### NOTES
Total Time: **~30 Minutes** &nbsp; Short Walk

Similar to yesterday morning, I am still mildly congested and my throat is mildly sore.

Unlike [yesterday](javascript:flick('thu');) I made it through today without the mid-afternoon downturn.

A walk around the neighbourhood before dinner was nice.

I am feeling better but lets see what [tomorrow](javascript:flick('sat');) has in store...

<!---->
## SATURDAY JAN 28 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **1** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

<h3 style="color:orange;border-top:1px solid orange;margin-bottom:24px;">RECOVERING FROM COVID</h3>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, Breathing, and Glute Bridges.

Trainer ~ 30-45 minutes. EASY effort. Keep the HR low. 
Breaking a sweat is ok, but under no circumstance should this feel harder than a walk.

Stretching 22 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **68 Mins** &nbsp; Walking

Woke up at 0530 with a headache.  Felt like a _"caffeine withdrawal"_ headache but I had a cup of coffee yesterday; it might be an _"Advil withdrawal"_ headache or maybe it is just COVID.  I am still congested (nasal) too.

QL is precariously tight so I swapped the trainer for a walk around _Swan Lake_.
