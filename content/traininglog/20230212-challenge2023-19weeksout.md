# CHALLENGE ROTH TRAINING - 2023
Week beginning [Sunday, February 12, 2023](javascript:flick('sun');)

**19** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Ride the momentum that I finished [last week](challenge2023-20weeksout) with.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **11.25 Hours**

I feel like I was **CONSISTENT**LY  COUGHING**

I feel good about getting every workout complete but there hasn't been much improvement with the nagging cough.

Apart from the bike commute to the pool in _Colwood_, all my riding was on the trainer this week; none of it was done with ERG mode and I am starting to feel comfortable with where the landmarks are on the Challenge Roth "Radstrecke" <small>(bike course)</small>

By the end of the week, 11 hours of training felt more like 13.

## SUNDAY FEB 12 ☁️
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, Breathing, Glute Bridges.  
1st: Run 30 minutes. EASY effort.   
2nd: Ride 60 minutes easy. Any bike you like. Inside or outside. Just keep it easy.

Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp;Run: **6.5 km** &nbsp;Rouvy: **27 km**

Laced up my shoes before the _Super Bowl_ for a short run 
mostly on dirt. I went about 10 minutes longer as the 
**effort was easy** and I was feeling good.

Looking at the activity afterwards, my heart-rate measured, 
from the strap, is still maybe 10bpm higher than what I'd 
considered square with the effort.  When is normal coming back?

Mobility work during the football game.
<!----->
I was a bit disappointed that a referee felt the need to get 
involved in the final stage of the game; whatever, time to get 
on the trainer.

I discovered more of the Challenge Roth course from _Zell_, 
through _Hilpostein/Solar_, passed the swim/bike transition, 
finishing at the top of the big hill past _Eckersmühlen_.  I 
**pedalled easy** as possible with _The Beastie Boys_ playing 
in the background.   61 minutes on the trainer with a 
normalized power of 139W and an average heart-rate of 112bpm 
(seems right).

Woke up to a coughing fit at 0412. 

After work, I rode back out to _Colwood_.  Good, **focused swim** 
and I had a lane all to myself.  I plugged the workout 
into my watch incorrectly (50m pool).

Caught in a hail storm for the commute home; that absolutely sucked.

Better sleep last night.  QL is a little stiff.  
Still dealing with this cough. 😡

Run was completed as written, **easy effort**, on dirt with a 
couple trips up _The Berm_.  Nice to just turn the brain off 
for an hour and just go. ![Run](/assets/jpg/run-20230214.jpeg)

## WEDNESDAY FEB 15 🌤
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Trainer 1:40: Remember to hydrate and fuel! 
10 minutes easy spinning to warm up. 
8x :30 moderate standing, getting out of the saddle to loosen up, :45 seated/normal riding. 
5 minutes easy spinning. 
6x 2:00 in a big gear/low cadence/high torque...170-210 watt range, 3:00 easy/normal spinning after each. 
4x7 minutes @ what feels like 1 gear easier than a 60 minute effort (aka: Find 60 minute effort..then drop it a gear easier and tick away) 3 minutes easy after each rep. 
5 minutes easy spinning to cool down.

### NOTES
Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **137W**

Another good sleep.  QL is less stiff but still dealing with 
this cough. 😡

It took way more experimentation then I wanted to invest but 
I was able to ride this workout without ERG-mode engaged on 
the trainer.
<!----->

### THE TRICK
Pair the Tacx app on my iPad (or iPhone) first, and start a 
_"Slope Workout"_ with a _"level gradient"_. Next, start the 
workout on the Garmin Edge with the interval times (minus 
any power targets).  Voila, no ERG-mode.

### THE CAVEAT(S)
I typically build cues for the workout intervals for the Garmin 
Edge.  I missed them tonight and I needed a reminder that 8x30sec 
was standing.  The first four of the 2 minute efforts, I were 
ridden with the correct wattage but I self-selected 99 RPM.  I 
remembered the low RPM requirement for the 5th and 6th repeats.

Also with a _"0% grade"_, I am out of gears.  
 &nbsp; &rarr; <small><strong>52x11 @ 65RPM = ~200W</strong></small>

Maybe next time, I'll set up the slope in the Tacx app to 1%; 
pfaffing with my iPad while in the middle of a workout feels 
like a terrible idea.  

I had 70g of a lemonade/maltodextrin mix in my bottle and it
went down well.
<!----->
### INTERVAL POWER
![Bike](/assets/jpg/bike-20230215.jpeg)

One thing that my mistake with the 2 minute efforts revealed was 
the delta in heartrate vs cadence and what it feels like to transfer 
effort from my heart and lungs into my legs.

I would not rate this workout as my favourite; my 
interface with the saddle was aggravated tonight. 
It could have been the late start too.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, Breathing, Glute Bridges.  
Swim 2500:
2 rounds (100 easy swim, 100 w/ buoy, 50 steady kick. Rest as needed)
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 all aerobic w/ a strong final 25 on each rep. Making sure you were staying aerobic and comfortable for the first part of each rep. R :45 after each.
4x 50 super easy to cool down.

Run 30 minutes EASY

### NOTES 
Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **2500m** &nbsp;Run: **7.5 km**

Restful sleep; still dealing with the cough.

I took the bus out to _Colwood_ as _Crystal Pool_ is still out of commission.

The whole swim was **on point** but with a 400m rep on the schedule...  

<!----->
**New 400m SCM PR by 13 seconds**.  Previous time was set 
[last June](ironman2022-10weeksout?fri) while swimming a 600m 
set.  I must have been going good back then.

I jogged home expecting to be a bit fatigued but I found an 
**easy rhythm** early and let it carry me back to _Tillicum_ 
and _Burnside_.

## FRIDAY FEB 17 ☁️
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, Breathing, Glute Bridges.  
Ride 75 minutes. Easy spinning. Inside or outside. Any bike you like. But saving the legs for the weekend. This is just an easy spin.

### NOTES
Total Time: **83 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **132W**

Cough, cough, and up way too early for a conference call.  Left hip flexor is the niggle of the day; maybe a 3/10.

I loaded up Rouvy (late) and rode the (simulated) Roth course from T1 to the base of the BIG HILL in _Greding_.  10% grade at 13km and 17km and then long shallow descent sums up this part of the course.

Sleep **5** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 90 minutes. Ideally this is....outside and fun. Effort should be easy to steady. 
Big day on [Sunday](challenge2023-18weeksout?sun). No need to make yourself exhausted from this ride. 

Run 30 minutes EASY.   
&middot; Ideally this is off the bike but anytime will work. 

Mobility 20 minutes

### NOTES
Time: **117 Mins** Rouvy: **147W** Run: **5.9km**

Not a good sleep last night; bit of a headache as well.

Jumped back on Rouvy to pedal the BIG HILL at Greding through to the base of Solar Hill in Hilpoltstein.  

Took me about 7:30 to get up to the bench where they had an aid station in 2022.  Not long after, the road pitches up again though gradually becoming flatter the further into the farmland you go.  21 minutes to the highest point on the course.

To make things even more realistic, I stopped at an aid station and looked after a biological need.

If I was listening to my body, I would gone down for a nap this afternoon.  Instead, I laced up my Lone Peaks for a trip out to [Panama Flats](javascript:flkty.select(2);) and kept my consistency streak for the week intact.
