## SUNDAY FEB 12 ‚òÅÔ∏è
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, Breathing, Glute Bridges.  
1st: Run 30 minutes. EASY effort.   
2nd: Ride 60 minutes easy. Any bike you like. Inside or outside. Just keep it easy.

Mobility 30 minutes

### NOTES
Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp;Run: **6.5 km** &nbsp;Rouvy: **27 km**

Laced up my shoes before the _Super Bowl_ for a short run 
mostly on dirt. I went about 10 minutes longer as the 
**effort was easy** and I was feeling good.

Looking at the activity afterwards, my heart-rate measured, 
from the strap, is still maybe 10bpm higher than what I'd 
considered square with the effort.  When is normal coming back?

Mobility work during the football game.
<!----->
I was a bit disappointed that a referee felt the need to get 
involved in the final stage of the game; whatever, time to get 
on the trainer.

I discovered more of the Challenge Roth course from _Zell_, 
through _Hilpostein/Solar_, passed the swim/bike transition, 
finishing at the top of the big hill past _Eckersm√ºhlen_.  I 
**pedalled easy** as possible with _The Beastie Boys_ playing 
in the background.   61 minutes on the trainer with a 
normalized power of 139W and an average heart-rate of 112bpm 
(seems right).

Woke up to a coughing fit at 0412. 

After work, I rode back out to _Colwood_.  Good, **focused swim** 
and I had a lane all to myself.  I plugged the workout 
into my watch incorrectly (50m pool).

Caught in a hail storm for the commute home; that absolutely sucked.

Run was completed as written, **easy effort**, on dirt with a 
couple trips up _The Berm_.  Nice to just turn the brain off 
for an hour and just go. ![Run](/assets/jpg/run-20230214.jpeg)

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Trainer 1:40: Remember to hydrate and fuel! 
10 minutes easy spinning to warm up. 
8x :30 moderate standing, getting out of the saddle to loosen up, :45 seated/normal riding. 
5 minutes easy spinning. 
6x 2:00 in a big gear/low cadence/high torque...170-210 watt range, 3:00 easy/normal spinning after each. 
4x7 minutes @ what feels like 1 gear easier than a 60 minute effort (aka: Find 60 minute effort..then drop it a gear easier and tick away) 3 minutes easy after each rep. 
5 minutes easy spinning to cool down.

### NOTES
Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp; Normalized Power: **137W**

Another good sleep.  QL is less stiff but still dealing with 
this cough. üò°

It took way more experimentation then I wanted to invest but 
I was able to ride this workout without ERG-mode engaged on 
the trainer.
<!----->

### THE TRICK
Pair the Tacx app on my iPad (or iPhone) first, and start a 
_"Slope Workout"_ with a _"level gradient"_. Next, start the 
workout on the Garmin Edge with the interval times (minus 
any power targets).  Voila, no ERG-mode.

### THE CAVEAT(S)
I typically build cues for the workout intervals for the Garmin 
Edge.  I missed them tonight and I needed a reminder that 8x30sec 
was standing.  The first four of the 2 minute efforts, I were 
ridden with the correct wattage but I self-selected 99 RPM.  I 
remembered the low RPM requirement for the 5th and 6th repeats.

Also with a _"0% grade"_, I am out of gears.  
 &nbsp; &rarr; <small><strong>52x11 @ 65RPM = ~200W<strong></small>

Maybe next time, I'll set up the slope in the Tacx app to 1%; 
pfaffing with my iPad while in the middle of a workout feels 
like a terrible idea.  

I had 70g of a lemonade/maltodextrin mix in my bottle and it
went down well.
<!----->
### INTERVAL POWER
![Bike](/assets/jpg/bike-20230215.jpeg)

One thing that my mistake with the 2 minute efforts revealed was 
the delta in heartrate vs cadence and what it feels like to transfer 
effort from my heart and lungs into my legs.

I would not rate this workout as my favourite; my 
interface with the saddle was aggravated tonight. 
It could have been the late start too.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Dead bugs, Breathing, Glute Bridges.  
Swim 2500:
2 rounds (100 easy swim, 100 w/ buoy, 50 steady kick. Rest as needed)
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 all aerobic w/ a strong final 25 on each rep. Making sure you were staying aerobic and comfortable for the first part of each rep. R :45 after each.
4x 50 super easy to cool down.

Run 30 minutes EASY

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 Mins** &nbsp;Swim: **2500m** &nbsp;Run: **7.5 km**

Restful sleep; still dealing with the cough.

I took the bus out to _Colwood_ as _Crystal Pool_ is still out of commission.

I think I just needed a win and with a 400m rep on the schedule, I took it.  New 400m SCM PR by 13 seconds.  Previous time was set [last June](ironman2022-10weeksout?fri) while swimming a 600m set.  I must have been going good back then.

The whole swim was **on point**.

I jogged home expecting to be a bit fatigued but I found an **easy rhythm**early and let it carry me back to _Tillicum_ and _Burnside_.
