### PLANNED WORKOUT
&mdash;  

### NOTES
Total Time: **93 Minutes**

Waterfront (clockwise) but instead of riding down _Sinclair_, I rode up the north (easy) side of _Mount Tolmie_ before heading toward _The Uplands_.  Near the _Oak Bay Marina_, I was passed by a young woman decked out in sponsored kit; she was on a pretty nice (new) Factor road bike too.  I passed her back before the golf course and held pace through to _Fisherman's Wharf_.  A couple more lead exchanges and I was at home quicker than I had planned.

Too stiff from the hike [yesterday](ironman2022-44weeksout?sat), I did a mobility routine, carved a pumpkin and called it a day.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2000m**

Clear and cold in the morning so I rode to and from the pool.   

I had an OK workout and did the _"shark-fin"_ set for the first time; it was odd at first and took some adductor effort to hold on to the board.  Typical Monday in that it was busy as the swim club filtered in around 0610.
