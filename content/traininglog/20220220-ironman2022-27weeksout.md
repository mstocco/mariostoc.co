# IRONMAN CANADA TRAINING - 2022
Week beginning [Sunday, February 20, 2022](javascript:flick('sun');)

**27** weeks out from race day.

## WEEKLY GOAL
The theme of this past month, hit it again.

## SUMMARY
Total Time: **11 Hours**

Before I knew it, there was just over 11 hours on the board for the week.

I felt really good on [Tuesday's Run](javascript:flick('tue');)  I missed the workout on the rollers on [Wednesday](javascript:flick('wed');) but got on the bike for a steady spin regardless.  The other big ride was on [Saturday](javascript:flick('sat');) where I built time/elevation on previous route linking _Thetis_ and _Mount Work_ (Regional Parks).

Some stiffness symmetrically in my neck and traps and a stiff left lumbar are the only niggles that I worked through this week.

4 rounds (100 easy free, 50 paddle-fist drill, 50 steady kick. Rest by feel after each)

### NOTES
Swim: **2400m** &nbsp;Bike Commute: **7km** &nbsp;Run: **15km**  
Total Time: **165 Minutes**

Solid day that started in the pool.  Probably should have swam the scheduled 2150m workout but I wasn't having any luck getting it loaded properly into my watch.  I was at the pool to swim, not to pfaff with my phone/watch on deck so I just went with a 2400m workout instead.

**Good energy** in the water today.  I got to share a lane with [Batuhan Kaya](https://www.endurance-data.com/en/result/543/840-batuhan-kaya/) which was pretty awesome (he swims with really good form).

That energy carried through to the commute home.  I remember the gassed feeling of riding after a hard swim last summer.  Today I was **feeling great** on the ride home.

Rain and showers filled in the rest of the day and I still had a run to do.  I was **wet and cold** on an out and back on _The Goose_ up to _Atkins Road_.  What I wasn't feeling on the bike ride home, I felt after the run.  Left glute and hip flexors worked over, quads tight too and running cold and wet didn't do much for my stiff neck either.

Time for a BIG dinner.

Good sleep but there is soreness; left glute (max) is tender, hip flexors (both sides) are tender and I have a stiff neck and traps.  Other than that, I am golden!

Basic chores around the house and an hour of Z2 spinning on the rollers.

Weather: <span style="color:orange;">-1¬∞C feels like -9¬∞C, wind NNE 33 km/h</span>

Terrible sleep last night; up with hunger, a loud windstorm from an arctic outflow and a stiff neck.  I did fall back asleep at one point but...

Despite feeling a bit dinged up (neck, traps, hip flexors), I had a big lunch and set out for an afterwork 8km run, that got stretched to 10 and then to 12!  In the moment, I was **feeling good** and the Tuesday Crew was happy to tack on a bit more.  I did a kilometre of run/walk warmup before the run too.

No rollers tonight.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
_Optional: Ride to/from the pool_.

### NOTES
Total Time: **55 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2200m**

What would have been the swim scheduled on [Sunday](javascript:flick('sun');) was do this morning.  I added an extra easy 50m to get myself back to the wall that had the pull buoy (original workout was for a 25m pool).  I felt like I has another great day in the water.  The strong 50m lengths in the main set were at my best effort and form; going wall to wall in about 45ish seconds.

I drove to the pool; it was -3¬∞C.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 85 minutes: *Yes, this is the same ride from last week. But last week you ended up outside. I doubt you'll get to go outside. Looks chilly!
20 minutes easy spinning to warm up. 
10x :20 high cadence, :40 easy spinning. 
5 minutes easy spinning. 
5x 5 minutes @ 30-45 minute TT effort, 3 minutes easy spinning after each.
10 minutes easy spinning to cool down.

Run 30 minutes EASY. This should be to start or end the day. Can be after the ride, but certainly does not HAVE to be after the ride.

### NOTES
Run Time: **30 Minutes** &nbsp; Roller Time: **40 minutes**

Started the day with a cup of coffee and the 30 minute run; standard route to _Quadra_ on the bike path that typically takes me ~32 minutes.  Today I was back in 30 and **feeling great**.

Work got in the way of me getting on the bike; at 2030 I pedalled easy until bedtime.

## FRIDAY FEB 25 ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2400: 
150 easy free. 
150 as 25 backstroke/25 free. 
200 w/ 4x sighting per 50. 
6x 50 steady kick. R :10. 
5x 300 w/ a steady turnover and consistent kick. R 1:00 after each. 
2x 50 easy to cool down.

Mobility 23 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **57 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2300m**

Good sleep last night.  Cold this morning (again) so I drove to the pool.

**Another good effort** in the pool despite missing the 200m sighting rep.  I realized my mistake while doing the 6x50 kick drill and put in a _"make up"_ 100m before starting the 5x300m set.  Reps 1, 2, 4 and 5 were within 1.2 seconds of each other and the 3rd rep was ~6 seconds faster than the others (maybe picked it up to pass someone).  Really stoked with that consistency; I am sure the 1 minute rest in between helped.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**

### PLANNED WORKOUT
MTB ~ 2:45-3:00 on the bike. 
Stay warm, Fuel early, fuel often, stay hydrated, have fun. Overall this is a "sustainable" effort ride. But you're going to push on a climb or three, and that is ok with me.

### NOTES
Total Time: **180 Minutes** &nbsp; Accent: **862m**

All the boxes checked on the ride today except for the stay warm part.  I had to roll down from the top of _Munn Road_ to _Woodridge Place_ to connect the two Regional Parks; it started to rain and felt like it wanted to snow.

### Receipt In the Bottle
50g Maltodextrin   
30g Country Time Lemonade  
20g Table Sugar (Dextrose)

I had Oreo Cookies too.
<!---->
Most of the significant hills that put my heart-rate north of 150 are around the Scafe Hill/Mount Stewart area.  There was some very heavy breathing cresting climbs in the first 1:30:00.

Part of me missed the Saturday swim after the ride, the other part understood that today was solid day on the bike.
