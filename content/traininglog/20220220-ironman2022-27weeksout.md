Solid day that started in the pool.  Probably should have swam the scheduled 2150m workout but I wasn't having any luck getting it loaded properly into my watch.  I was at the pool to swim, not to pfaff with my phone/watch on deck so I just went with a 2400m workout instead.

**Good energy** in the water today.  I got to share a lane with [Batuhan Kaya](https://www.endurance-data.com/en/result/543/840-batuhan-kaya/) which was pretty awesome (he swims with really good form).

That energy carried through to the commute home.  I remember the gassed feeling of riding after a hard swim last summer.  Today I was **feeling great** on the ride home.

Rain and showers filled in the rest of the day and I still had a run to do.  I was **wet and cold** on an out and back on _The Goose_ up to _Atkins Road_.  What I wasn't feeling on the bike ride home, I felt after the run.  Left glute and hip flexors worked over, quads tight too and running cold and wet didn't do much for my stiff neck either.

Time for a BIG dinner.

Good sleep but there is soreness; left glute (max) is tender, hip flexors (both sides) are tender and I have a stiff neck and traps.  Other than that, I am golden!
