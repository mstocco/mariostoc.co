Mobility 17 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **15 km**

Running on tired legs, but mostly on gravel paths and even some honest, in the forest trail sections.  I felt good after 45 minutes, better than my measured pace suggested (thought I was going faster).

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2400m**

Fatigue from the weekend did carry over into the swim.  There were moments where I when I was contemplating calling it early but I went one more rep, then another.  Then I was done at 2400m.  I spent time in the hottub with a jet on my lumbar; that helped as it was tight this morning.

Pretty solid nap after work too.

Lumbar and neck are stiff.

Rode to and from the pool though it was a pretty chilly morning.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 30 minutes. Nice and easy.  
Run w/ friends. 
65-75 minutes on your feet. 
Keep it as easy

### NOTES
Total Time: **93 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **10 km**

Rollers in the morning this week, before work and before coffee.  My back felt tight when I woke up but was fine after the spin.

The run with Yauki and Vince went well.  Vince asked for some hills so we did the Gorge route.  Took it as easy as I could and finished really strong for the final 500m (up hill finish).

Lumbar was not noticed during or after the run but there are some odd niggles as I type this.  My right peck (top) and front deltoid are angry for some reason.

### NOTES

Really cold wind from the east for the commute to the pool this morning.

I didn't feel like I had much in the tank, start to finish today; I was dreading the hard 50s but I did the math and broke it down into just 5 hard lengths (10x50m Odds High Effort, at a glance, registered as 50m full gas ten times).  Whatever was in my head, I got the work in.
