Run 95 minutes. Easy effort. Ideally on dirt. Stay well fueled. This is your chance to run easy at YOUR easy effort. Take advantage. No rushing on this run.  Basically the same as last week.   
Mobility 17 minutes

### NOTES
Total Time: **95 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **15 km**

Running on tired legs, but mostly on gravel paths and even some honest, in the forest trail sections.  I felt good after 45 minutes, better than my measured pace suggested (thought I was going faster).

### NOTES
Total Time: **80 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2400m**

Fatigue from the weekend did carry over into the swim.  There were moments where I when I was contemplating calling it early but I went one more rep, then another.  Then I was done at 2400m.  I spent time in the hottub with a jet on my lumbar; that helped as it was tight this morning.

Pretty solid nap after work too.

Lumbar and neck are stiff.

Rode to and from the pool though it was a pretty chilly morning.

Run w/ friends. 
65-75 minutes on your feet. 
Keep it as easy

### NOTES
Total Time: **93 Minutes** &nbsp; Run: **10 km**

Rollers in the morning this week, before work and before coffee.  My back felt tight when I woke up but was fine after the spin.

The run with Yauki and Vince went well.  Vince asked for some hills so we did the Gorge route.  Took it as easy as I could and finished really strong for the final 500m (up hill finish).

Lumbar was not noticed during or after the run but there are some odd niggles as I type this.  My right peck (top) and front deltoid are angry for some reason.

### NOTES

Really cold wind from the east for the commute to the pool this morning.

I didn't feel like I had much in the tank, start to finish today; I was dreading the hard 50s but I did the math and broke it down into just 5 hard lengths (10x50m Odds High Effort, at a glance, registered as 50m full gas ten times).  Whatever was in my head, I got the work in.

<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT

18 minutes easy spinning. 
8x :30 high cadence, :30 easy spinning. 4 minutes easy riding.

Mobility 18 minutes

### NOTES
Moving Time: **103 Minutes** &nbsp; Vertical: **438m** 

Woke up @0450 thinking it was Friday and with a bit of panic that I didn't have my swim kit ready. 

Option A: Ride outside and a chance to go and **play on the MTB**.  Same stepped climb for the first 30ish minutes up to the north end of _Thetis Lake Regional Park_ before getting on to 500m of very familiar single track.  That may have been my best run, no dabs, no bobbles so when I reached _Bellamy Trail_ (fireroad), I looped back to do it again.  Second run, no dabs, no bobbles; two for two on clean runs.  Third time was a charm and I cleaned the trail one last time before heading for home.

When I first started riding, there were 2 hills on _Bellamy_ that used to be steep enough that I wasn't guaranteed to pedal to their crests.  One of those hills is a _"rock garden"_ and I climbed that easily twice tonight.  The other is heading southbound and is tricky because at the base of the climb is a significant mud hole.  The first time I ever pedalled to the top of that hill was in summer when the mud hole was dry and I could carry momentum into the effort.  Tonight, I got over that hill without the help of momentum and barely broke a sweat doing it.

As I reflect on this mid-week ride, it is actually a big win for me.

## FRIDAY MAR 11
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Swim 2000: 
4 rounds (100 easy swimming, 50 steady kicking. Rest as needed) 
1200 continuous/steady swimming. Don't worry about the time. Just find a nice steady rhythm, keep breathing and settle in on a sustainable stroke. 
4x 50 super easy to stretch out and cool down. 

Run 30 minutes EASY. Nice and easy.


### NOTES
Total Time: **60 Minutes** &nbsp; Swim: **2000**

Ride in drizzle on the way to the pool but it was dry on the way home.

The 1200m was done with a nice steady rhythm.  I had a bit of navigation to do but for the most part, it was an honest representation of where I am at for 1200m.  The last 50m was my best length where I didn't put more effort in, but reached a bit more.
