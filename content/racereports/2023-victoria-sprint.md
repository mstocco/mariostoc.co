A local race that I entered on a whim.

I seeded myself at the front of the group and when the starter said _"Go!"_, I hit the water with intension.

A bit of an odd side-stitch during the swim; I am guessing that I was 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> out of the water.

A good transition for me and I was off on the bike.

On the bike, I was caught by _Niki S_.  She was quick heading up the hill on _Old West Saanich Road_ but I'd put time into her on the flat and downhill sections.  I passed her before turning on _West Saanich Road_ and I became her _"rabbit"_ she'd chase though to T2.  

My heart-rate was around 145&#8239;BPM on average, up into the 150's going uphill.

Another _"ok"_ transition and I settled into a comfortable 5:10/km pace on the trail.  _Niki_ would pass me for good early into the run; I'd get caught by a couple more men but that's it.  I watched who could have made ground on me after the turn around but I was solo through to a solid finish.
