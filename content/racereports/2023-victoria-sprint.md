Just a local race that I entered on a whim.

I seeded myself at the front of the group and when the starter said _"Go!"_, I hit the water with intension.

A bit of a side stitch during the swim, I am guessing that I was 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> out of the water.

A good transition for me and I was off on the bike.  

Another ok transition and I settled into a comfortable 5:10/km pace on the trail.  __ would pass me early and I'd get caught by a couple more but that's it.  I watched who could have made ground on me after the turn around but I was solo through to a solid finish.
