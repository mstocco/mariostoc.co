## PREAMBLE

The alarm goes off, I feel like I'd had just fallen sleep. My iPad is near by and I have the registration page preloaded in the browser.

57... 58... 59...  click.  I am in.

Was is really that easy?

For fun, I open a second browser window; that webpage says the race is sold out.  I complete the registration form on the first page; we are good to go.

Preparation starts 38 weeks out from race day; the bulk of the activities are in the daylight limited winter. 

A very consistent streak is interrupted by COVID at the end of January.  Rolling an ankle and breaking my cuboid threatens to derail everything just 13 weeks before the race.

Maybe the cherry on top during this training build was planning and marrying my sweetheart on May 21st!

![Transition 1](/assets/jpg/IMG_5124-770x550.jpeg RACE MORNING)

It could not have been a nicer summer morning in _Franconia_.

The drive from _Nürnberg_ to Parking Area 3 in _Heuberg_ is relatively smooth.  The Autobahn is fast.  The line of cars on the country road moves slowly but a glance at the clock on the car's dash, there is time.

Walking to the swim start there are generally those comfortably strolling to find a spot to spectate and those more anxiously moving to get into the transition area.  I am definitely in the later group.

In the distance, music is pumping from the sound system at the swim start.  It beckons triathletes to the south shore of the canal.

I stop on the bridge and take in the scene.  Roth is no longer a video on YouTube; I am here.

I make a beeline for my bike. Bottles placed, bike computer on and the pressure in my tires topped up.

Almost two hours to wait; my start time is 0750.

![Start of the professional race.](/assets/jpg/IMG_1941-770x550.jpeg THE SWIM &mdash; MAIN DANAU KANAL)

Early this spring, I logged into the Challenge Roth Registration site and changed my estimated finish time to a faster time.  The thought was that I'd get myself into a cohort of swimmers that swim roughly the same pace as me.  I also thought I'd get into the water sooner and get a time buffer for the run.

It doesn't work that way at Roth.  Was I placed in a group of faster swimmers?  Yes, but my group is third from last to start.

The waiting is over as Group 15 is called.  We form a line and it is a slow procession to the edge of the water.

The announced water temperature is a near perfect 21°C. A short swim to the start line and BOOM!  The cannon fires and I am swimming with 250 new friends.

Starting this late, the glare from the sun on the eastern leg to the first bridge is blinding.  Buoys on the water are hard to spot in the sun but the first turn is under a bridge; that is pretty easy to see.
<!---->
I follow the mass of arms and heads.  There is more contact than I've experienced before. I am ok with it.

I never found the definitive answer regarding the best way to swim this canal.  Some say that close to shore is faster.  Conversely, I've heard that there isn't much of a difference.  For the long leg west, I swim the buoy line.  It appears many more are swimming the shore; I am pretty sure my overall energy expenditure would be higher getting caught up in that mess.



My effort through this entire swim has been easy, really easy.  I recall getting out of the water last year at IRONMAN Canada, I felt like I could swim another lap.  Right now, I am super excited to get on my bike.


![The two loops of the District of Roth](/assets/jpg/IMG_1945-770x550.jpeg THE BIKE &mdash; TWO LOOPS OF LANDKREIS ROTH)

Transition is smooth and I am riding my bike over the bridge.  I have bike legs right from the first pedal stroke. 

The speed is higher than I envisioned in the beginning.  On my bike computer, I have one predominant metric displayed.  My heart-rate is in the low 130s, I could get it lower.

My head is up as I approach a crowd of cyclists navigating the first solid hill past _Heideck_.  I am passed by a guy, tricked out with a black bike, black trisuit and black helmet with a really long tail and a blacked out visor.  He is standing up, going for broke with maybe 160 kilometres to go.

"The Batman" pedals himself into a slower rider and I hear a crunching sound.  He swearing in German and he swerves, swerves some more before hitting the deck with an even louder crunch of more broken carbon.  Yelling ensues, fists are clenched.

I don't know who was right and who was wrong but course marshal on a motorcycle behind me also witnesses the spectacle.  I leave it to officials to break up the donnybrook.
<!---->
Now conscious of riders coming up behind me with speed, I hear another disc wheel approaching.  Blue kit, blue bike, it is Patrick Lange with Ben Kanute in tow.

My turn to yell, _"Go get him Ben!"_

The bike course is net downhill for the 10 kilometre stretch to the village of _Greding_, home of the "big hill".  On my left, Daniela Ryf goes screaming past me.  She is rock solid and fast!  I note the time, 1 hour, 11 minutes into my ride.  There should be more of the female race coming through soon.

Heading up _Greding_, I pick off fellow age groupers that beat me to the base of the hill.  I am almost feeling guilty of how effortless the climb is.

I am quickly put in my place; another rider flys by on my left much faster than I am expecting.  I see a flash of pink on the tri-suit and catch the number plate all athletes have zip tied to the sea tubes of our bikes; it is number 24.

_"Way to go Ernie!"_
<!---->
Professional triathlete, Ernest Mantel looks back and flashes me a big smile.  If my mood was good going up this hill, my energy was over the top now.  Ernie and I have a connection as we both share the same coach, Elliot Bassett (<a href="" target="_blank">Mountain Endurance</a>).  Ernie gives me a fist pump of encouragement before flying over the horizon.  I continue on.

What goes up, must come down.  A set of switchbacks provide a brief moment of fun.  I am passing other age-groupers; a quick glance behind before entering the next corner and I am amazed how much distance I am putting into those I am sharing this hill with.

Through the village of _Offenbau_ I got some perspective into the eventual result of the female race.  Lisa Norden rolls passed me; more than 30 minutes after Daniela Ryf.  I don't think I'll need to ask who will be crowned winner on the day.

Chelsea Sodaro would pass me next and gave her a cheer.  It dawns on me that within the professional field, I have only cheered for the American athletes.

![In Hilpoltstein, a slight right turn reveals this view.](/assets/jpg/IMG_1935-770x550.jpeg SOLARER&#8239;BERG)

There is a DJ adding to the atmosphere and as I pedal through the chute and into the crowd lining the hill, the song _"Jump"_ by Van Halen starts.  I played the album _"1984"_ until the vinyl wore out when it was this song was released.  I rode a BMX like my hair was on fire back in those pre-adolescent years.

In an instant, I was that kid again.

From _Morlach_ back into _Hilpostein_, the road is fast and there is a bit of a tailwind.  Carina is waiting on the corner as I make the final turn to complete the first lap of the course.  I am really happy to see her.

Second loop and there is a difference this go around.  Those that just made the left turn in _Eckersmühlen_ are looking at another 85 kilometres and the group energy changes.  I see more people taking breaks on the side of the road.  Faces have less smiles, postures on the bike look more slumped.

The easterly headwind down to _Greding_ has a little more oomph and it is getting warm.
<!---->

The pockets of crowds dotting the countryside road remain enthusiastic.  The volunteers at the aid stations are still happy and enjoying the day.

So far, I am right on track with the calories thirst however, is no longer a gauge I think I can rely on. I am drinking water whether I feel the need or not.

The aid stations on the bike course are frequent and I am never out of water thankfully.

I recognize a couple of faces still cheering at _Solarer&#8239;Berg_; most of the crowd has left for _Roth_ to watch the professional field at the finish line.  With more room, I am up and over this hill quicker this time around.

I notice a German participant named Ralf.  He passes me near _Morlach_, I pass him back on the section into _Hilpostein_.  Our back and forth continues the section returning to the swim start.  I think I've dropped him for good on the descent near the locks.

800m remaining in the bike leg, Ralf reels me in and races into transition ahead of me.


![](/assets/jpg/IMG_1956-770x550.jpeg THE RUN &mdash; THE TEST)
A volunteer takes my bike; another volunteer hands me my Run Bag.  The professionals make the change into their running shoes look easy.  I struggle to find a place to sit in a very hot and crowded tent.

My race starts now but it doesn't seem that way to the spectators lining the street heading out from T2.  My walk is intensional and planned.   People encourage me to run in German, Spanish and once in English.  I kindly reply, "Not to worry, I got this."

The plan was always walk out of T2.  5 minutes and I am still walking.  Could I start here, sure but there is a downhill that probably would do more harm than good to jog down right now.  I hit the lap button at 10 minutes.

The plan that Elliot and I discussed a few days ago was 4 minutes on, 1 minute walking.  I program this interval for 60 reps into my watch.  Pressing the lap button once starts the workout and from there, I go on auto-pilot.

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beeeeep...
<!---->
Through 8 kilometres, I am feeling fresh.  Up ahead seems to be a familiar yellow trisuit, I am closing in on it.

During the bike leg, the bib numbers are worn facing toward the back; for the run, they are facing forward.  I run along side the yellow tri-suit and blurt out, "Hello Ralf, do you speak english?"

"Yes, a little.  You are _The Canadian_..."

I explain my run/walk strategy; we chat briefly each time we pass each other.  Eventually, Ralf stops catching me on my walk reps.  I press on.  I thought I'd dropped this guy on the bike and he proved to be resilient then.

15 kilometres into the run and this path along the canal continues further than I can see.  Things are quiet.  Less people talking.  The day is setting in.

I am drinking water through the aid stations.  The little extra in the cup I pour over my head.

At this aid station, there isn't a volunteer with a gel in hand.  Not to worry as the PowerBar Gels are consistently found on the middle table.
<!--->
One for the road. Green Apple flavour.  This is my first time using PowerBar Gels.  They are sitting well and I am liking the flavours.  Some are caffeinated and I make sure to mix in the non-caffeinated packets.

My feet are getting tired and I am not feeling fresh but the trek to the north end of the canal seemed longer than this return trip south.  I will take the positives where I can get them.

Through the forest and down the hill.  I am somewhere past the 28 km sign; Carina is here to cheer me on.  We walk together for a bit.  Any worries regarding the ability of my right foot holding strong over the distance are gone.  My confidence in completing this day is high but having Carina beside me for a short walk is just what I need at the moment.

"Ernie!" Instead of blowing past me on the bike, he is now heading back to his home stay. We stop for a bit and he asks how my day is going.  My answer is, "Fantastic!" We learn about his great day here at _Roth_ as well.

My watch has been beeping every fourth and then one minute.  Saying goodbye to Ernie, then to Carina, I am back to my 4 minute interval workout.  Heading through Roth's old town is a blast.  Lots of turns on old cobblestone streets.  The crowds are still cheering and it is very uplifting.

Ernie cautioned me about _"the hill"_. Maybe a 5% grade but it goes forever.  I am chipping away at it, still 4 minutes at a time.

Out of the corner of my eye, I catch an American flag on the bib of another participant grinding her way up the hill.  I say, "hello."

Whitney is here with her husband and her mom.  This is her 8th full distance triathlon, it is her mother's 30th!  Whitney has been to Victoria for our local 70.3 and the conversation starts from there.

IRONMAN Italy, I had Davide to share the pain of the remaining kilometres with.  At IRONMAN Canada, I had the Kevin right on my tail pushing me to the finish.  This year, it is a casual conversation about triathlon that has me forgetting the dull ache in my quadriceps.

Whitney may have been on pace for a PR.  I wish her well as she continues up the road.  I walk for a bit.  If I would just look at the time on my watch, I'd see that I was ahead of my best pace too.  I am content with soaking in the wonderful moment in a charming German town.

From the side of the run course, I hear my name called.

Florain, a local triathlete that I met during my recon ride of the course last Sunday, had been following my progress throughout the day and made his way out to the last couple kilometres of the run, just to cheer me on.  It is his goal to one day participate in his hometown race.  

His English is 100 times better than my German.  I hope I an properly conveying how awesome and encouraged I feel with him being to cheer me along, just as he said he would a week ago.

Less than two kilometres to go, the Ryson/Canyon cheering section has the music cranked.  I don't remember what they were playing but I know it was a tune that I liked and I am still smiling.

Crossing the railroad tracks, it is just a few hundred metres to go.  A head of me is a group of three, all wearing the same kit.  I look back to see a lone athlete, maybe 80m back.  If these distances hold, I'll have a finish line picture with just myself in frame.

The race owner, Felix greets me with a huge congratulations as I enter the stadium.

The finish line announcer calls out my name and there is time between me and the other finishers for him to share with the crowd that I had just married my sweetheart and that we were in Roth enjoying our honeymoon.

I cross the line.  The run is over, the race is over.  I look back to soak in the stadium atmosphere.  Kristine Wellington offers me a finisher's medal.  She congratulates me on finishing before dark.  I never took note of how much daylight was left.
