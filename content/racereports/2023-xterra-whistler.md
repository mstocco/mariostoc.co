## My first off-road triathlon.

It is a new experience to roll out of bed, jump on my bike and 
in about a mile, roll into transition on race morning.  No day 
before bike check-in, just pick the spot you'd like to rack 
your bike; coffee is just over at that table.

I was expecting the air temperature to be cold.  All week, 
Whistler has be waking up to ~6°C; this morning it's a balmy 
9°C.  The plan to stay out of the water is amended and I swim 
out to a floating dock; a short 5 minutes in and out of the 
lake.

A small field of elites hit the water first.  It's a mass 
start from the beach for the rest of the ~100 age-group 
participants.  I find a spot on the water's edge, swimmer's 
left.

The horn sounds.  A female athlete goes by my left shoulder 
like she is shot out of a cannon.  I walk briskly into the 
water until I am waist deep. Time to dive in.

The water feels cold. I check in with my breathing, everything 
is good to go.

Maybe ~80m from shore, we swim past a floating swim dock.  The
crowd I'm in is slowly pulling away from me. I may not be one 
of the faster fish in this little pond today. I sight to a red 
buoy in the distance.

You know, I kind of suspected as much; the flurry of arms and 
swim caps that pulled away from me at the beach are starting 
to come back to me.

At the red buoy, I claim my space on the inside.

I cross the first timing mat; 28:39 is okay but not lighting 
the lake on fire either.

They have us wearing the timing chips on the outside of our 
wetsuits.  I lose a bit of time having to briefly remove the 
that chip to get my leg out of the wetsuit.  Not ideal but I 
stay on task.

Leaving T1 and I am currently leading the M50-54 division. My 
legs feel ok.

Pedalling toward the first hill, I struggle with wet hands
to put my gloves on. First place zips past. I am in second 
grinding up a steep and rocky hill.

_Tin Pants_ is a buffed out trail that is fast with 
deceptively sketchy parts; loose sand over hard packed surface 
had my front tire plowing in a corner (or three).  I do not go 
down but judging by some skid marks, someone ahead of me did.

The eventual winner of the Female 35-39 category passes me.
She looks like she can handle her bike and I followed her 
line.

_Peaches in Regalia_ is the first  bit of single track and the 
rabbit I am chasing makes time on me going up the twisty 
hillside; I regain some lost time bouncing over the roots.

_Centennial Trail_, a short section of fire road with a steep 
pitch and loose rocks.  I find my own line up over the crest 
of the hill. I am now ahead of my pacer.

A dip into the forest for more single track on a trail called 
_Ms. Pinky_, then to a trail called _Toads of the Short 
Forest_. I pick my lines without the help of someone to 
follow.

F35-39 passes me again; my lead on her was short lived.  We 
descend _Son of Mr. Green Jeans_ and a trail called _Jellyroll 
Gumdrop_.  She is almost out of sight heading up the steeper 
bit of a wide gravel road.

Luck puts me back in contact. A tricky bit on _Pinnochio’s 
Furniture_ costs F35-39 some time. Still, she is quicker than 
me up the hike-a-bike section and down the switchbacks of 
_Dina Moe Hum_, I lose more ground. This is starting to feel 
like a race.

My left QL is stiff, my quads are burning, I take another gulp 
from my water bottle.

First lap is almost done but not before riding _Fountain of 
Love_.  Behind me, someone askes to ride through. I find space 
and a guy powers by. He's in my age division. I press to match 
his pace when a rock, or a root, or whatever, puts me hard on 
the ground.  

<!---->
I pick myself up quickly and get back on my bike but 3rd place 
just rode around the corner and out of site.

First lap of the bike is done and I am back on the sandy 
corners of _Tin Pants_.  Another woman, this one in the F40-45 
division is charging hard.  I follow her line; she's pulls me 
back to the leader of the F35-39 division.

Second time up _Centennial_, I pass both women.

Maybe it was my fuelling, maybe it was being just a bit more 
familiar with the trails on the second lap, but male or 
female, I am not passed on the bike course again.

I'm in _Transition_, left shoe on, right shoe on.  I notice 
that F35-39 is still relentlessly in pursuit.  I hightail it 
out on to the run course.

The trail is gradual uphill for the first kilometre.  Without 
the sound of wheels and suspension bounce over terrain, it is 
very peaceful.

I hear footsteps. F35-39 passes me for good.  
_"Hey, great ride."_ &nbsp; I get a fist pump, _"You too!"_

<!---->
It is mostly groomed downhill for the next two kilometres.  I 
have a gel and a cup of water as I pass the aid station. Both 
my IT bands are now tight, right where they intersect the 
lateral aspect of each knee.  I acknowledge the discomfort and 
carry on.

I was told I'd know that I'd reach the _WALL_ when I got 
there.  Yes, it is pretty evident.  I walk up.

A rocky and loose decent off the hill continues to the aid 
station.  I am being passed by a number of people.  I am not 
counting, my attention is focused on being safe and not 
turning an ankle.

A _Zoot_ trisuit passes me.  The age written on her calf let's 
me know she's my age.  She runs with rhythm.  Her name is 
_Linda_ and I try to keep up.

I see where her foot hits the trail, I do my best to put my 
foot there too.  In a minute or two, I forget about my sore 
knees, my fatigued quads or the fact that I was even in a 
race. The final two kilometres simply flowed.

**Verdict:** Xterra Whistler is a lot of fun!
