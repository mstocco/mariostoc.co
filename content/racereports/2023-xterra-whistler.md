My first off-road triathlon.

---


It is a new experience to roll out of bed, jump on my bike and in about a mile, roll into transition on race morning.  No day before bike check-in, just pick the spot you'd like to rack your bike; coffee is just over at that table.

I was expecting the air temperature to be cold.  All week, Whistler has be waking up to ~6°C; this morning it feels like a balmy 9°C.  The plan to stay out of the water is amended and I swim out to the first floating dock; a quick 5 minutes in and out of the lake.

A small field of elites hit the water first.  It is a mass start from the beach for the rest of the 1xx age-group participants.  I find a spot on the water's edge, swimmer's left.

The horn sounds.  The female athlete goes by my right shoulder like she is shot out of a cannon.  I walk briskly behind her, keeping pace with her thrashing until I am waist deep.  It's my turn to go.

The water feels cold to start.  I check in with my breathing, everything is a go.

Starting to the left and breathing to my right, I notice the crowd passing me as we clear the floating swim dock, maybe 80m from shore.  I may no be the faster fish in this little pond this morning.  Find the red buoy and chive on.

And I suspected as much.  The flurry of arms and swim caps that seemed to pull away from me at the start are starting to come back to me now.  The water still feels cold.  I breathe and continue on.

Swim Time:  28:39  Not lighting the lake on fire...

Transition was a bit slow.  They had us wear the timeline chip on the out side of our wetsuits and with that, I lost a bit of time having to briefly undo the velcro of that chip to get my leg out of the wetsuit.

Regardless, I left T1 leading the M50-54 division.

I pedalled toward the first hill and with wet hands, I struggled to put my gloves on.  First place zipped past, I am in second heading up the first hill.

_Tin Pants_ is a buffed out trail that is fast with deceptively sketchy parts; loose sand over hard packed surface had my front tire plowing in a corner or three.  I didn't go down but judging by the skid marks, someone ahead of me did.  The eventual winner of the Female 35-39 category passes me.  She looked like she could handle her bike so I followed her line.

_Peaches in Regalia_ is the first real bit of single track.  My rabbit makes time on me going up the twisty hillside, I make up the distance to her bouncing down the roots and rocks.

_Centennial Trail_ is a fire road with a steep pitch and loose rocks.  There is a line that I see and I power to the top of the hill ahead of my pacer.  A dip into the forest for more single track on a trail called _Ms. Pinky_.  She is gone and I am riding _Toads of the Short Forest_ without a help of someone to follow.

My lead evaporates in about 5 minutes as F35-39 passes me again, just before the descent of _Son of Mr Green Jeans_.  She is pretty much out of sight heading up _Hydro Hill_.

I catch back up to her just before the hike-a-bike section of _Pinnochio’s Furniture_. but on the _"flowy"_ bits of _Dina Moe Hum_, she puts more time into me.  

My left QL is stiff and sore, my quads are burning and my calves are feeling cooked from the hike-a-bike; this is starting to feel like a race.

The last bit of single track on the first lap is called _Fountain of Love_; From behind, I hear someone asking to ride through.  I find space and as he does, I notice he's in my age division.  I press to keep pace and a rock or a root or whatever I wasn't paying attention to, puts me on the ground.  I pick myself up quickly and get back on my bike but 3rd place just went by and he wasn't waiting on me.  

First lap of the bike is done and I am back on the sandy corners of _Tin Pants_.  Another woman, this one in the F40-45 division is charging hard.  I follow her line and as we get to the bottom of the hill, she's pulled me back to the leader of the F35-39 division.

The steep hill on _Centennial_ is where I ride past them both.

Maybe it was my fuelling, maybe it was being just a bit more familiar with the trails on the second lap, but male or female, I am not passed on the bike course again.

I'm in _Transition_, left shoe on, right shoe on.  I notice that F35-39 is still relentlessly in pursuit.  I hightail it out on to the run course.

The trail is gradual uphill for the first kilometre.  Without the sound of wheels and suspension bounce over terrain, it is very peaceful.

I hear footsteps.

To my left, I offer, "Hey, great ride."  I get a fist pump, "You too!"

It is mostly groomed downhill for the next two kilometres.  I have a gel and a cup of water as I pass the aid station. Both my IT bands are now tight, right where they intersect the lateral aspect of each knee.  It is a thing that I acknowledge and continue chugging along. 

I was told I'd know that I'd reach the _WALL_ when I got there.  Yes, it is pretty evident.  I walk up.

The view near the top was just like in the brochure.

A rocky and loose decent off the hill continues to the aid station.  I am passed here by a number of people.  I am not paying much attention except to safe safe and not turn an ankle.

A _Zoot_ trisuit passes me.  The age written on her calf let's me know she's my age.  She runs with rhythm.  Her name is _Linda_ and I try to keep up.

I see where her foot hits the trail, I do my best to put my foot there too.  In a minute or two, I forgot about my sore knees, my fatigued quads or the fact that I was even in a race.  The final two kilometres simply flowed.  Welcome to trail running, welcome to Xterra.
