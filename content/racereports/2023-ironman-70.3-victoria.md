## ANOTHER MORNING MISTAKE

It is 0355 in the morning, the coffee is brewing and the 
second cinnamon bagel in the toaster.

Last year's frantic rush to get out the door was due to my 
lack of organization.  Today, my trouble is with whatever I 
ate last night. My 4th trip to the bathroom, I feel a bit 
behind schedule.

It is all green lights on the drive to _Beaver Lake_; parking 
is easy this year and I am on a bus with some time to spare. 
Things are going okay, or so I thought.

In transition, I unpacked my bag, placed the bottles in their 
cages, bike computer on and ready, pumped up the tires and...  
_Where is my helmet?_

It's right where I left at the front door. This sport is 
about problem solving and for the second year in a row, I made 
things way harder on myself, before the start of the race.

Big shout out to my friend Batuhan for lending me his helmet 
and to Carina for racing to the venue to drop off the one I 
left at home.

## THE SWIM - ELK LAKE
I never heard what the water temperature is today but the 
conditions are perfect for a sunrise swim. 

My self-induced chaos cost me an oppertunity to warm up in 
the lake. No matter, the water is my happy place. I am through 
the timing gate and on rhythm starting with my first stroke.

Breathing and effort are both spot on for the distance. My 
biggest task now is navigating the frog kickers, back strokers 
and one guy frantically tugging on the zipper of his wetsuit.

One length of the lake complete, now for the trip back. I find 
_"feet to follow"_ for the first time in a triathlon.  Just 
as I think, _"how perfect is this..."_ my man swims into a 
pair of slow swimmers then stops swimming himself.

I swim around the congestion just like that, my gift of a 
draft in the water is over.

I hit more congestion at the last buoy, just 100 metres from 
the beach. I wonder, _"people, why stop here?"_

## SAANICH PENINSULA LOOP
Unlike my helmet, I didn't forget my _Gabba_.  Standing in 
front of my bike, the air temperature does not feel that cold. 
Leaving that bit of clothing behind seems to be the right call.

Descending the hill on _Old West Saanich Road_, I can't help 
but think how easy the climb up was this morning.  I glance at 
the heartrate number on my bike computer. 137 BPM, I should 
think about backing off a bit.

The first aid station is on my right, I zip past making a 
mental note of how much I've consumed from my concentrated 
bottle. My calories are on schedule.

_Martindale Road_ to _Tulista Park_ is the longest time to be 
in the aerobars.  My _quadratus lumborum_ handles the effort 
along this stretch of road like a champ.

Halfway point of the bike course and I am rolling past the 
second aid station. Time to swap out an empty water bottle 
for the bottle behind my seat. The concentrated bottle is now 
half full. Perfect.
<!----->
This year, road construction diverts us passed _Downey Road_
so it is all _West Saanich Road_ heading south into _Brentwood 
Bay_.  Normally the hills of this section zaps my legs; today, 
everything is rolling by very quickly.

Even the climb up _Willis Point Road_ feels easy this morning.
I breifly stand on the pedals on the incline near _Durrance 
Lake_; reality of the last +75 kilometres puts me back in the 
saddle quickly.  Maybe it is best to relax and have another 
slug from the concentrated bottle. There are a few more hills 
left to go after all.

Last punchy hill on _Oldfield Road_ and I am still pressing.

I rolled up to the dismount line on _Brookleigh_.  I feel 
great; my reward is 2:59:36 on the bike computer!

## THE PLANNED WALK/RUN
Before leaving the _Transition Area_, my stomach gurgles. That 
same dangerous gurgle that presented itself before I left the 
house this morning is back. It is a beeline to the port-o-johns.

I start the planned walk/jog just walking. It was was the best 
thing for my stomach in the moment.

A little more than a kilometre in, I catch up to another walker. 
Mitch from _Calgary_, is going to complete his life-to-date, 
bucket list event and I start the conversation we'll share for 
the next 19 kilometres.

Plugged into my watch is an interval workout, 25 reps, 2 
minutes of jogging, 1 minute of walking.  Mitch is keen on doing 
it with me so I press start.

We didn't complete them all, but we did get around the lake in way 
better time than just walking.
<!----->
On the last lap, with just over a kilometre to go, Carina is 
at the _Rowing Club_ waiting for me to saunter by. She has 
ridden there on her gravel bike and greets me with a smile and 
a kiss.  Mitch continues to get his finish line; I hang back 
for a bit and make plans with Carina for the rest of the day.

I run a strong final kilometre to the finish.  I think I have 
set myself up for a good week of training.

## FINAL THOUGHTS
A 33:42 swim, 20<sup>th</sup> in my Age Group with only one open 
water swim just a few days ago.  I should be happy with that.

The bike is another beast to disect.  Although I gave back 31 
spots to my AG, I finished in the 45th percentile. The weather 
was near identical to last year, where did this year's 
improvements in time come from?

* New TT Bike with a new position, Di2 shifting, an extra cog on the rear wheel, 28c tires versus 25c.
* A winter on a smart trainer where I am pedalling in the aerobars.
* Dropping weight.  This time last year, I averaged 79.6 Kg, this past week 76.4 Kg was my average (-7 pounds).
* Slight changes to the bike course (highway section vs bike path, moving the turnaround on Willis Point versus Downey Road).
* Recently breaking a bone in my foot, putting more emphasis on bike fitness.
* Maybe I am just fitter.
<!----->
Maybe my biggest acheivement today is winning the mental 
battle to **NOT RUN**. 

I caught a comment from the peanut gallery, a friend of a 
friend who doesn't know me or the current state of my foot; 
A previous version of me would have outwardly reacted.

Still, the battle of _"could"_ versus _"should"_ played out in 
my head for 2 trips around the lake.

Because of the walking, I feel like I finished with bullets in 
the chamber, with the option to fire them at a bigger event in 
just 4 weeks time.
