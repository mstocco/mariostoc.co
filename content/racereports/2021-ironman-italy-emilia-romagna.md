This is the story of my first IRONMAN triathlon.

I first registered for this race in the fall of 2019 with the 
hopes of participating in the 2020 event.  Unfortunately, a 
certain global pandemic had other plans.

Italy's hardship with COVID-19 has been well documented and I all 
but abandoned hope of travelling to Italy for this race.

My desire to complete an IRONMAN remained.

I registered for IRONMAN Canada and that race's return to 
_Penticton, BC_ then spent the balance of this 2021 focused 
getting fit.

If anything COVID has taught the world is that certainty is 
anything but certain.  With just five weeks before IRONMAN 
Canada's _rescheduled_ date, that event was postponed 
for yet another year.

And so...

Ciao Italia!  Piacere di rivederti! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

## Getting to Cervia

Travel from Canada to Italy required Carina and I to have 
proof of full vacination, negative COVID antigen tests 48 
hours before our flight and a contact tracing form that was 
easy to complete.  

This was our first big trip since COVID-19 turned the world 
on its ear.  Delayed flights because of a mechanical issue and 
staff shortages made for a very long day of travel.  We 
started our day at 8:30am Saturday in Victoria and arrived at 
9pm Sunday in Cervia.

Ironically, we flew over Penticton enroute to Italy.

<!---->
Luckily, I was able to get some sleep on our very delayed 
flight between Toronto and Frankfurt.  Luftansa accomodated us 
on a later flight from Frankfurt to Bologna and we took the 
train for the final leg of our trek to Cervia.

Once in Cervia, we stayed at <a href="https://www.hotelorchidea.it/" target="_blank">Hotel Orchidea</a>; 
we could not have asked for a nicer location.

Our room was spacious (room to unpack and build my bike) and 
had a gorgeous view overlooking the beach and the swim start.

Stephania and her entire staff at Hotel Orchidea were 
exceptional too!  Kind, helpful and very accommodating; they 
made our time in Cervia an absolutely wonderful experience.

## Seafood, Pasta and the Beach

Arriving late Sunday night, we had Monday to Friday to adjust 
to a 9 hour time change. Vacation life in an Italian seaside 
village made that easy.

I got some swimming, biking and running in too.

## Race Day: The Alarm Goes Off

![Sunrise on Race Day](/assets/jpg/IMG_3487.jpeg)
I think I slept well all things considering.  My first task 
is to carry water bottles to my bike.

If you have read any other race reports for IRONMAN Italy, 
you already know that the transition area is very long. 
Everyone is made to enter the transition from the end 
furthest from the swim start.  It is a full mile of walking 
just getting to my bike.

Back at the hotel an anxious feeling is 
taking hold.  I work through it, put my wetsuit on and after 
a bite of a croissant and a sip of a cappuccino, I walk 
across the street to the starting pens.

<!---->
## The Swim: Enter the Medusa

Yesterday, I watched crew set the remaining buoys for the 
clockwise, "L" shaped swim course.  From the vantage point of 
my hotel room (6 floors up), the distance from the first turn 
buoy to the southernmost turn buoy (the longest leg) showed me 
just how long the swim is going to be.  Seeing   
the entire of the swim course from above was intimidating.  I had 
swam the distance in training but that was in a lake and 
without this picture.

I figure my swim time to be around 80 minutes so I set myself 
up at the back of the 1:10/1:20 corral.  Behind me are the 1:20-1:30 and 1:30+ corrals; maybe a couple hundred people.  

Slowly the masses shuffle toward the starting gates where 8 athletes are being released 
every 12 seconds.  It is almost my turn and I take a one last glance behind me. 
There are just a couple dozen people left to enter the water.

I am starting at the back of the pack.

<!---->
![Go Go Go](/assets/jpg/IMG_3759.jpeg)
There is a building, _"thigh high"_ swell rolling in this 
morning (guessed based on the swim marshals on stand up 
paddle boards).  This makes sighting the first buoy a touch more 
challenging. Fortunately, there is a sailboat further out with a mast 
that I am able to use.  Two days ago, I swam out to the 
first buoy in choppy conditions in 9 minutes;  
with the swell, it oddly feels like I am there quicker and with less 
effort.

At the first turn buoy, I stop to dump some water out of 
my goggles; then begin the long leg to the southern turn buoy.

<!---->
I am hoping to "find some feet" for a bit of help through the 
water.  This never happened.  The crowd I am sharing the water with seem 
nervous.  It is swim around one 
person to have to swim around the next.  Time to swim my own line, 30m off the buoys.

Getting to the south end of the swim course means a turn 
toward the beach. The next buoy being a right turn back north. 
I am swimming effortlessly by myself but at 
the turns, there is the some congestion with other 
swimmers.

One thing that I really need to make peace with was the 
jellyfish; or _medusa_ in Italian.  I have done well to this point.

A stinging line from my chin to my right ear on let's me know they are not harmless.

It isn't bad; the vaseline I applied to my 
face, hands and feet beforehand is helping.  Overall, there are far 
fewer jellyfish today compared to the swims earlier 
in the week.

<!---->
My line on the way north to the final turn buoy is not  
my best.  There is a red fisherman's buoy that pulled me 
and the others off the offical swim course and after the final 
turn, I made a mistake of swimming in with the swell and not 
quite toward the swim exit.

70 minutes in the water, and now I am crossing the timing mat; 
I feel like I could have swam that loop again.

## T1: A Long Strip Of Soft Sand

![My bike in transition](/assets/jpg/IMG_3485.jpeg)

Just out of the water, I jog the soft sand to the 
transition area.  A quick bio break in a free port-o-john now 
where did I rack my bike?  It is a long trek to my 
bike and a long trek to the bike exit, everything goes 
smoothly.

<!---->
## The Bike

Riding out of _Cervia_ is a series of roundabouts before the 
road turns west toward the salt flats.  Were there flamingos 
to be seen?  Yes, hundreds and that is pretty cool.

Just like any morning ride after a pool workout, I was 
expecting my legs to feel heavy for the first bit of the ride.  Today 
is no different.  It feels like there isn't much juice to 
squeeze and it doesn't take long for everyone that 
I passed in the water to return the favour; lots of people whiz by me on 
the ride out of town.

Regardless to how awful my legs are feeling, I stick to an effort 
that I think is appropriate. I open a gel and continue toward 
_SS3bis_ (the expressway closed just for the race).

I am astonished by the amount of litter on the course; 
dropped bottles, dropped flat kits, strewn about the road.  What 
looked like a new pair of Oakley sunglasses randomly discarded 
has me start a monetary tally in my head to pass the time.

<!---->
I reach _SS3bis_ (20 km into the ride).  I am expecting 
my legs to have come around but there still isn't much doing. 
Both hamstrings are tight and my left glute isn't right 
either.  Nothing to do except pedal and eat.

![Riding out of Cervia](/assets/jpg/IMG_0852.jpeg)

<!---->
At the 30km mark, the ride crosses over to the southbound lanes.  The is an aid station handing out just water in huge 1.5L bottles.

A slight tailwind helps the effort going south. I am spending time sitting up while my 
legs continue to feel quite unhappy.

I open another gel and just as I am about to enjoy it,  I am stung by a small wasp!  Once on the 
lip and once on the tip of my tongue.  That little guy gets me better 
than the jellyfish did.

At the south end of the expressway, the bike course exits to the west, leading up to the town of _Forlimpopoli_.  My lip still hurts enough that I've forgotten about my legs. 

_Rocca Albornoziana_, an amazing 14th century fortress is my left and to my right, a second Aid Station is handing water and calories.  I stock up with a couple gels for the next section of the course.

The scenery through this section of the bike course is picturesque; vineyards, trees, views and a false flat to the foot of 
_"the hill"_.

Back home, I have a hill that mimics the ride up to _Bertinoro_; 
I feel prepared and my legs have come around (sugar 
intake catching up with the effort perhaps).  

<!---->
![The Argon 18s](/assets/jpg/IMG_0853.jpeg)

The community support is growing the closer I get up to the 
village at the top of the climb.  The time in _Bertinoro_ is brief, but the music is pumping and 
people are cheering in before the route turns back downhill.

From _Bertinoro_, down to the flats near _Santa Maria delle 
Grazie di FornÃ²_ and back to the northbound lanes of the 
expressway, I feeling like I found a nice groove.  It is a long  strip of expressway heading 
to the north end of the bike course.  It feels like time is going by 
quickly.  Before long, I am at the 
north end making the turn for my second trip south.

<!---->
At this point in the ride, it is getting later in the 
afternoon.  In the distance, a dark, ominous thunderstorm 
is forming to the southeast, near the town of _Cesentico_.  I am 
relieved to see _Bertinoro_ to the southwest, still basking in sunshine.

After a quick restock of gels at the aid station in 
_Forlimpopoli_, I am heading toward _Bertinoro_ for the my second trip up the hill. 

One drop, quickly turns into two and after making a lefthand 
turn at the foot of the hill, drops turn to rain.  With the 
crack of thunder right overhead, the rain turns into a deluge 
and the road up to the village becomes a river in almost an 
instant.

The music is still pumping but the crowd in _Bertinoro_ is nowhere to be seen.  I would be taking cover from this storm too. 
My second descent off the hill is an extremely precarious exercise in wet braking with carbon rims.

The momentum that I enjoyed flying down this hill two and half 
hours earlier, is not to be had this time; my focus is staying upright. 

<!---->
I am off the hill and the rain continues to hammer down.  Despite 
living in a wet part of the world, I have never pedalled a 
bike in the type of rain that was falling from the skies this 
afternoon.

It is my last trip north on the expressway. 
the rain bouncing off the asphalt so hard that it creates an 
amazing rainbow effect on the surface of the road.  Turning off the 
expressway and on to _SP254_, the rain continues to come down. 
Some sections, I ride the centreline because the lane was awash.

Even the flamingos in the salt flats had left to find shelter.

The rain finally eases just as I roll into _Cervia_. 
Despite the foul weather, that last 40km is a new personal best 
(1:16:57 @31.2 kph).  My mood is great and I (almost) don't 
want this bike ride to end.

<!---->
## T2

Two phases complete, one to go.  I nail a rolling dismount 
off my bike and slowly make my way down the long transistion 
to my run kit.  I am ok with the long walk as every step 
helpes to shake out the longest ride I've ever completed. My 
glutes and hamstrings in particular are tight/fatigued 
from the ride; everything else, back, neck, stomach are all 
good.

![After the change into my run kit](/assets/jpg/IMG_3517.jpeg)

<!---->
## The Run/Walk

Running shoes on, I head out of _T2_ feeling pretty 
good, or at least far better than I could have imagined. 
A large crowd is met at the intersection of _Viale Milazzo_ and 
_Viale Cristoforo Colombo_, the cheering is electric.

My task is to walk the aid stations and pick away at the 
distance in between.  That works through the first 19km 
(about 2 hours). Now the clockwork effort of the run starts to turn into a slow fade.  I give myself permission 
to walk.  Interestingly, I am ok with it.

![Run Rabbit Run](/assets/jpg/IMG_0856-3.jpeg)

<!---->
The aid stations have Maurten gels, water, Gatorade, a  
Red Bull branded cola, bananas and some energy bar that I am not familiar 
with.  I stick to what was known to me, the Maurten Gels for 
as long as I can. The further down the road I go, the 
more I want something sweeter.  Gatorade is the first to 
disagree with my gut.  I switch to the cola which sits ok 
with me until the last lap.

![5 days before my 50th birthday.](/assets/jpg/IMG_0854-550x550.jpeg Thirteen Hours, Twenty-two Minutes)

The sun has dropped below the horizon and dusk is turning into night.  Most of the crowds that lined the streets earlier 
are gone.  I suspect half were athletes now in bed, getting 
some sleep before the 70.3 tomorrow. The other half being 
family of the particpants of this event, most of whom have 
already crossed the finish line.

I am on my last trip around this 4 lap course, making my way to _Milano Maritima_.  I grab a banana from an Aid Station, it is the only thing that seems to sit with my stomach now.  My abs are sore, my quads are especially sore.  6 kilometres to go.

My sad shuffle once again turns into a walk.  Something in italian is said to me; I look to my left and another athlete passes me, encouraging me to run with him.  Despite the language barrier between us, we worked together to 
push through the soreness.  I stay on his shoulder as we weave through the north end of the course.  He spends some time on my hip as we make the final turn south.  We walk the final Aid Station.  It is now just one table with product, most of the tables have been disassembled and packed up for the night.

I never get to a _"dark spot"_ mentally (whatever that means); I was in Italy after all and thankful for the moment, 
the people and the unique experience I was having.

A little more than a kilometre to go, I see my biggest fan up ahead.  Carina gives me a kiss, hands 
me a Canadian flag and races me to the finish.  She'll beat me 
there tonight.

## Final Thoughts

I couldn't have asked for a better experience for my first 
IRONMAN distance triathlon.

Getting to/from Cervia was relatively easy.

The people of Cervia are very welcoming and the hospitality 
industry of the region is more than prepared to host a full 
and half distance triathlons over the course of a weekend. 

I am not a fan of swimming with jellyfish.
