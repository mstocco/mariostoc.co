# Race Reports

COVID-19 through the world for a loop and races over that period were cancelled, postponed or out of reach for most.  Through it all, I stuck to my own plan and found a way to get fit enough in 2021 to complete my first 70.3 (virtual) and 140.6 distance triathlons.

## 2021 Races
<ul class="alt">
 <li class="item">
  [Victoria Half and Sprint Triathon](2021-victoria-half)
 </li>
 <li class="item">
  [IRONMAN Italy - Emilia Romagna](2021-ironman-italy-emilia-romagna)
 </li>
</ul>

Racing is just one day, the time in between is where the magic happens for me and I document that process in my [TRAINING LOG](/traininglog/latest).
