## THE SWIM - OKANAGAN LAKE
So much made about the temperature of the lake.  I never did get hear the measured temperature but over the loud speaker it is announced that wetsuits are a go.  Nothing left to do here, it is time to leave my spot in the transition area and make my way into the lake.

## THE ONE-LOOP BIKE COURSE
A crowd has packed the street around the start of the bike course.  The cheering is incredible.  Heading south on _Main Street_ is emotional.  Maybe it was the effort from the swim.

The residents along _Lakeside Road_ are out and cheering.  I see a large Canadian flag set up on my left.  Close by is the Italian flag.  I call out, _"Forza Italia!"_  The family gives me an extra cheer and as I ride away, I hear _"Forza Azzuri!"_

_McClean Creak Road_ is a hill.  I tackle it with the least amount of effort.  The day is still to young.

## MAKING THIS HAPPEN
The sun is really hot.  The long grass in transition was cool and damp from the morning dew when I left.  I would love to be putting my shoes on that cool grass; it feels like there is heat radiating from the lawn right now.

Ahead of me is the 12% grade of _Vancouver Avenue_.  People are running past me, I am walking up.

I've run out of hill to walk, time to go.

Gatorade?   Yes please.  I am handed a cup and I put it down the hatch.  The residual carbonation, the acidity both hit the back of my throat.  It is Pepsi.  Normally I am good with cola but there is a reaction and it is not comfortable.
