<h2 style="margin-bottom:4px;">THE SWIM - OKANAGAN LAKE</h2>
So much made about the temperature of the lake.  I never did get hear the measured temperature but over the loud speaker it is announced that wetsuits are a go.  Nothing left to do here, it is time to leave my spot in the transition area and make my way into the lake.

I have time for a warm-up swim.  The water is warmer than the air.  I feel ready to swim.

The pre-race atmosphere at [IRONMAN Italy](2021-ironman-italy-emilia-romagna),  was a _"Euro-Dance Party"_ on the beach.  The tradition here at IRONMAN Canada is a lone bagpiper rocking a catchy tune.

I am standing ahead of 70-80 minute group; right where I need to be.  The shuffle to the start line begins.

Beep, Beep, Beep.  It is my turn to go.  The lake is shallow for a bit from the shore.  I finally take that first stroke; it feels great and I am off.

The 300m marker is to my right and I am on auto-pilot.  I feel great the entire swim.

<h2 style="margin-bottom:4px;">THE ONE-LOOP BIKE COURSE</h2>
A crowd has packed the street around the start of the bike course.  The cheering is incredible.  Heading south on _Main Street_ is emotional.  Maybe it was the effort from the swim.

The residents along _Lakeside Road_ are out and cheering.  I see a large Canadian flag; close to that is an equally large Italian flag.  I call out, _"Forza Italia!"_  The family gives me an extra cheer!  As I ride away, I hear _"Forza Azzuri!"_

_McClean Creek Road_ is a hill.  I tackle it with as little effort possible.  The day is still too young.

Rolling into _Osoyoos_, I've spent the majority of _Highway 97_ in the aero-bars; my lumber is starting to act up.  

_Richter Pass_ is a slow and steady affair at least for the climb to the top.  The race to the valley below is a very different affair.

If you passed me on the way up, don't worry, there are more up-hills for you to catch me again (maybe).  Zoommm!
<!----->
The distance from the between the Aid Station going up _Richter_ and the one in _Cawston_ is being felt.  My water bottle has been empty for some time and I can use a bio-break.  My lower back needs a break too.   Finally at kilometre 106, I that break is here.

Leaving _Keremeos_, I have family on the roadside cheering me on.  Forty-something years ago, my aunt would have been babysitting me in a tiny town in _Northwestern Ontario_, now she is watching me doing my best to save some energy for the next hill, Highway 3A up to _Yellow Lake_.

The kicker by the golf course is an out of the saddle effort.  I despite my lower back, everything else is feeling really good.

Zoommmm...  Lots of downhills for the trip to _Willowbrook_ are the reward for the climbing so far.  An out and back section finally gives me a chance to see my friend from _Victoria_.  I did some quick math and he's maybe just 4 minutes behind and closing.
<!----->
Climbing out of _Willowbrook_, I am thinking about my back and how soon before Kevin passes me.  

The turn back on to _White Lake Road_, has a other crowd of people cheering on the participants.  _"Look at him, he is still smiling!"_  That was someone commenting about me!  I scan the crowd and see Katie and Jason, more friends of mine from _Victoria_. 

Jason runs beside me for a short bit, his words of encouragement hit me well.  My back pain disappears and I am in the aero-bars for the mostly downhill leg back to _Penticton_.  I don't think Kevin is going to catch me now.

<h2 style="margin-bottom:4px;">MAKING THIS HAPPEN</h2>
The long grass was cool and damp when I left transition this morning.  My bike is racked and I am sitting on ground, putting on my running shoes.  I find myself wishing for that cool grass again; it is really hot out now.  The procrastinating is real.  Let's get going.

Ahead of me is the 12% grade of _Vancouver Avenue_.  People are running past me, I am walking up.

I've run out of hill to walk up, time for me to get going for real this time.  In front of me is 4 kilometres of and out and back section of the _Kettle Valley Rail Trail_ [KVR]. The surface is a very fine gravel, not quite sand but it feels loose.

This is the heat of the day and this trail is false-flat uphill.  I am noticing the grind.

At the turnaround, I see a smile.  My sweetheart is at the 5km marker and cheering me on; I am instantly happy.  I stop for a kiss and turn for the trek back to _Penticton_ with a huge smile on my face.

With the turnaround, I see Kevin; he is at most 30 seconds back.  I am caught for sure now.

Back on asphalt.  I walk to the bottom of _Vancouver Ave_.  10 kilometres in the books, 20 miles in front of me.  I am feeling good.

Gatorade?   Yes please.  I am handed a cup and I put it down the hatch.  The residual carbonation, the acidity both hit the back of my throat.  It is Pepsi.  Normally I am good with cola but there is a reaction and it is not comfortable.
