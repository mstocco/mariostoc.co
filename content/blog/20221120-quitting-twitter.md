# Quitting Twitter
_November 20, 2022_

It's not you, it's me...  
No actually, Elon, it is you.

My life is busy enough and I work to eliminate distractions where ever I can. 
So deleting an account on some other guy's website was really easy to do.

My opinion of Twitter's new owner has gone from a bit eccentric to absolutely repugnant. 
The weird-guy public persona I could look past but I never let a person tell me who they really are twice.


Here is the thing, he was never going to get $8 <small>USD</small> out of me for a _"checkmark"_, 
but I was in the market for a +$55,000 <small>CAD</small> Model 3.

Seriously, what an idiot.
