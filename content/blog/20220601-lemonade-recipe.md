# My 90g Lemonade Recipe
Based off of Maurten's marketing claim of 5:4 glucose to 
fructose ratio, here is how I mix up a bottle for a bike 
ride...

## Ingredients
 &nbsp; Western Family Lemonade drink mix  
 &nbsp; Sugar  
 &nbsp; Maltodextrin  
 &nbsp; Water

## Directions
Mix the dry ingredients in your favourite water bottle using 
the following amounts:  
 &nbsp; 42g of Table sugar.  
 &nbsp; 38g of Lemonade drink mix.  
 &nbsp; 10g of Maltodextrin

&lowast;<small>If it is going to be hot outside, add a dash 
of table salt.</small>

Maltodextrin will clump when wet; throughly mixing all the
dry ingredients while dry, greatly reduces this clumping.

Add 2/3 water to the bottle and shake vigorously.

Top up the bottle with water and ride.
