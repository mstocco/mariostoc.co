# My 90g Lemonade Reciepe

Based off of Maurten's marketing claim of 5:4 glucose fructose ratio, here is how I mix up a bottle for a bike ride...


## Ingredients

* Western Family Lemonade drink mix
* Sugar
* Maltodextrin
* Water


## Directions

Mix the following together in a standard 710ml bottle (or whatever fits on your bike).  
38g of lemonade drink mix.  
42g of table sugar.  
10g of Maltodextrin

<small>&star; If it is going to be hot outside, add a dash of table salt.</small>

Maltodextrin has the tendency to clump.  Throughly mixing with the other granules greatly reduced the clumping.

Add 2/3 water to the bottle and shake vigorously.

Top up the bottle with water and ride.

Makes one bottle.
