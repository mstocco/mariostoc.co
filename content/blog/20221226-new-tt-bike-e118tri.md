# NEW TT BIKE - I BOUGHT A FRAMESET
<p class="timestamp">December 26, 2022</p>

After all of [my inner machinations](new-tt-bike-kicking-tires) 
regarding this bike or that frame, it looks like it's a 
_Boxing Day Sale_ for the win; That made the decision easy.

According to their website, _Cycling Avenue_ strives to be the 
best online bike store for refurbished bikes.  Similar to 
_The Pro's Closet_ except Canadian, located in _Montreal_.

They have a new, size small, Argon 18 E-118 Tri+ on sale today 
for 60% off. Where did that credit card go?

### The new frameset arrived 
<p class="timestamp">January 9, 2023</p>
But what I purchased from _Cycling Avenue_ was a size *small*, 
this one is a *medium*.

They are happy for me to send it back for a refund but are 
unwilling to exchange it for the size I ordered. I am a 
disappointed customer.
