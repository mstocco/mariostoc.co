# 2022 Training Review
_December, 31, 2022_

With the COVID-19 pandemic finally put in our rear view 
mirror, this blog entry is a look back on my 2022 triathlon season.

## WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR

In 2022, I realized a life time goal of completing 
[IRONMAN Canada &dash; Penticton](/racereports/2022-ironman-canada-penticton); 
a back-of-mind dream that I harboured since the mid-nineties!  

A whole host of events happened over the past few years that 
made this dream come true.  Noteably, meeting 
<a href="https://www.mtnendurance.com" target="_blank">Elliot Bassett</a> 
in 2019 certainly was a catalyst.  The City of Penticton re-licensing 
the event after an almost decade hiatus being another.

I completed my first [full distance race](/racereports/2021-ironman-italy-emilia-romagna) 
in 2021 (Italy), but it was this year's [IRONMAN Victoria 70.3](/racereports/2022-ironman-70.3-victoria) 
at the end of May, that cemented the confidence needed to complete the Penticton course in August.

Here is how I got there...</p>

</div><h2>455 HOURS OF SWIM, BIKE, RUN
</h2><div style="height:355px;width:325px;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;"><p>
A similar amount of training hours last year 
compared to 452 hours logged in 2021.

Swim volume was up in 2022.  Not in the Gorge and a lot less 
time in _Elk Lake_ (algae, gross) but more time in _Shawnigan Lake_ 
made for a good open-water season.

Swim Distance: **279.5 km** &nbsp; Time: **91.6 hrs**

I rode _The Malahat_ less in 2022 but made up for it by riding 
the _Great Trail_ with my mountain bike.  The majority of my 
road mileage was done on my TT Bike.

Bike Distance: **5,575 km** &nbsp; Time: **252.3 hrs**</p>
</div><div style="width:325px;display:inline-block;margin-left:10px;vertical-align:top;"><p>Since
replacing (upgrading) my running hobby for triathlon, a trend 
of reduced annual running volume has (naturally) occured. 

In 2022, that trend continued. Only so many hours in a day.

I was running well through the spring, setting an all-time 10K PR of 46:38 in April.

A broken pinkie toe heading into June certainly derailled that momentum.

Run Distance: **1,086.9 km** &nbsp; Time: **111.5 hrs**<br /><sup style="color:#777;">(does not include 16 hours walking with a broken toe)</sup></p>

### AVERAGE SWIM PACE

Inline with what I see at the pool, there are the _"fast kids"_ 
and everyone else.  Within the _"everyone else"_ cohort, I am a 
bit quicker than most.

### AVERAGE RUN PACE

Nothing has changed with this chart since I first saw an 
example of it 4 years ago.

In the triathlons that I've entered, there has been a 
common theme; get out of the water in good shape only 
to watch a cyclists whiz past me for the next  hours. 

This past fall, I purchase a used, direct-drive trainer to have 
a bit of variety for this winter training season.  That adds 
another metric to confuse and already over-measured hobby. 

### WATTS UP WITH THAT?

The above shows how much power I've ridden at so far 
compared with other Garmin users in my age cohort.


Thankfully I have a great coach that talked me off the 
ledge after I looked at this graph.

## GOALS FOR 2023

I put Challenge Roth on the 2023 calendar; that will be my "A" 
race for the year.  I am also signed up for the Victoria 70.3 
as well.

During the lead up to previous races, I have been able to find 
a consistant training groove but after the race, I have taken 
time off.  

I hope to correct that this year and take advantage of the 
fitness bump from the race.

Before we get to the triathlons, there is a wedding in our future.

**May 21st. This is happening!** <span style="color:red;">	&#10084; </span>

And once again, I fell into the trap of marketing and purchased 
a new TT frame.  Building another bike will be fun but I have a 
goal of selling/purging some of the extra gear that has started 
to accumulate.
