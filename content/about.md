# ABOUT ME
Hi, I'm Mario Stocco.

If you are reading this, it is highly likely that you already know me, but if you don't, 
here is the scoop...

I am currently employed as a Solutions Engineer at _Distributel Communications_
in Canada, working on a number of initiatives around our
best-in-market telecommunications platform.  I live and work in
_Victoria, British Columbia_ and I am engaged to the sweetest
woman ever!

Before Distributel, I spent over a decade as a contractor for hire,
building custom tele-<wbr />communication solutions for customers from
Florida to California and all across Canada.

In my free time, I can be found running, biking and swimming in preparation to complete my first IRONMAN triathlon; 
specifically Ironman Canada - Penticton on August 29th, 2021.

I am documenting that process daily in my [TRAINING LOG](/traininglog/).
