# About Me


If you are reading this, it is highly likely that you 
already know me, but if you don't, here is the scoop...

I live and work in 
_Victoria, British Columbia_ and I am engaged to the
sweetest woman ever!

I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at 
_Distributel Communications_ in Canada, working on a
number of initiatives around our best-in-market 
telecommunications platform.  

Before _Distributel_, I spent well over a decade as a 
contractor for hire, building custom tele-<wbr />
communication solutions for customers from Florida 
to California and all across Canada.

In my free time, I can be found _running, biking_ and 
_swimming_ with the goal of completing my next 
Ironman distance triathlon.
