# About Me

<br />If you are reading this, it is highly likely that you already know me, but if you don't, here is the quick scoop...

I live and work in _Victoria, British Columbia_ and I am <strike>engaged</strike> married to the sweetest woman ever!

I am currently employed as a Senior Voice Architect at _Distributel, a division of Bell Canada_, working on a number of initiatives around our best-in-market telecommunications platform. 

Before _Distributel_, I spent well over a decade as a contractor for hire, building custom tele-<wbr />communication solutions for customers from Florida to California and all across Canada.

In my free time, I can be found _running, biking, swimming_ and then documenting it all [here](/training/).
