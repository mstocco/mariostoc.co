# About
Hi, I'm Mario Stocco.

If you are reading this, it is likely that you know me, but if you don't, 
here is the scoop...

I am currently employed as a Solutions Engineer at _Distributel Communications_
in Canada, working on a number of initiatives around our
best-in-market telecommunications platform.  I live and work in
_Victoria, British Columbia, Canada_ and I am engaged to the sweetest
woman ever!

Before Distributel, I spent over a decade as a contractor for hire,
building custom tele-<wbr />communication solutions for customers from
Florida to California and all across Canada.

I can also be found on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/21702937)
and [Garmin](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/_canadian) as 
I run, bike and swim in preparation to complete my first Ironman triathlon.
